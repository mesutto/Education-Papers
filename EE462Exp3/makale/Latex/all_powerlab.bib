abstract = {—Future power systems will be characterized by the massive deployment of high power converters for so many applications (e.g. FACTS, HVDC, energy storage systems, etc.). These devices imposes new challenges on the operation and control of power systems, especially in terms of frequency support. Power converters tend to naturally decouple the new power production units from the AC power grid, disabling natural frequency response. It is expected this situation decreases the total system inertia affecting the ability of power system to overcome system frequency's disturbances. Wind power industry has developed several controllers to provide inertial response on wind turbines generators (WTG) enabling the frequency response: e.g. Artificial, Emulated, Simulated, or Synthetic Inertia. However, there is a clear lack of knowledge about activation scheme used for these controllers and how they work in practical manner. This paper proposes three activation schemes for synthetic inertia controller on WTG based on full rated power converters (FRC): (i) continuously acting (ii) under-frequency trigger and (iii) maximum-frequency gradient trigger. Simulations considering a test system are used for evaluation of the proposed activation schemes. The main contribution of this paper is the definition activations schemes for the synthetic inertia controller and the practical simulations results demonstrating the under-frequency trigger provides the best dynamic response in term of system frequency response.},

abstract = {—We present an FPGA-based design approach that will allow motor control and on-board condition monitoring to be achieved in parallel using the same set of physical variables. The key idea lies in exploiting the parallelism of FPGAs to achieve the joint objectives of control and monitoring using common physical variables, namely motor phase currents. For illustration, a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) governed by Field Oriented Control (FOC) and health monitoring using Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is considered. Since FOC is computationally intensive, the control algorithm is optimized for speed using distributed pipelining and an FFT-core is utilized for MCSA. The design stage uses MATLAB/Simulink for the reference control coupled with HDL coder for VHDL generation. The synthesis and timing analysis are done with Altera's Quartus II. The tool-chain allows easy analysis and optimization of model-based motor control algorithms. The results show that the joint objectives can be obtained with decreased current and torque ripple at the expense of modest increases in resource utilization. Index Terms—FPGA, motor current signature analysis (MCSA), permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)},

abstract = {— This paper presents a novel simplified cost effective binary based mechanism for eliminating problems in existing condition monitoring and diagnostic techniques. The existing techniques are engraved with problems like high cost of their implementation, failure to detect multiplicity of faults, complicated diagnosis system, expert knowledge, inherent ambiguities etc. The mechanism developed in this work gives flexibility to monitor faults at incipient stage and avoid catastrophic cascading of faults that leads to plant shutdown and consequent long repair/maintenance periods. The developed system detects working status of sensors, location of faults, no. of faults at that particular instant, acknowledgement of faults, and health status of electrical machines connected to the system. These diagnostic parameters have been extracted by implementing a simple logic circuitry. The main advantage of this system is that it can be applied to any rating of electrical machines. The input parameters for the system are the outputs of the sensors which are capable to measure variation in parameters like current, voltage, flux, torque, speed, temperature, and vibration etc. due to occurrence of faults. The test results of the proposed mechanism have been found to be highly encouraging, accurate and extremely fast providing the much needed protection of machines.

abstract = {– The steady growth of installed wind power which reached 200 GW capacity in 2010, together with the up-scaling of the single wind turbine power capability -7 MW's has been announced by manufacturers -has pushed the research and development of power converters towards full scale power conversion, lowered cost pr kW, and increased power density and the need for higher reliability. Substantial efforts are made to comply with the more stringent grid codes, especially grid faults ride-through and reactive power injection, which challenges power converter topologies, because the need for crowbar protection and/or power converter over-rating has been seen in the case of a doubly-fed induction generator. In this paper, power converter technologies are reviewed with focus on single/multi-cell power converter topologies. Further, case studies on the Low Voltage Ride Through demand to power converter technology are presented including a discussion on reliability. It is concluded that as the power level increases in wind turbines, medium voltage power converters will be a dominant power converter configuration.},

abstract = {—In permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), high-frequency (HF) signal injection has been extensively investigated for permanent magnet temperature (PMT) estimation, in which PMT is estimated from the temperature-dependent HF resistance. Existing studies require prior knowledge on the HF resistance and neglect the fact that PMT is temporally correlated. This paper proposes a state-space model for PMT estimation, in which PMT is modeled with a piecewise linear equation to explore the temporal correlation. The state-space model is nonlinear due to unknown model parameters which is required to be known in existing studies. This paper proposes to use expectation maximization particle filter (EM-PF) for simultaneous PMT and model parameter estimation. After EM-PF estimation, the state-space model becomes linear, so Kalman filter is employed for online PMT estimation. The proposed EM-PF along with a Kalman filter based approach can explore the temporal correlation among PMTs to improve the estimation performance, which can be hardly achieved in existing studies regarding PMT as a time-independent parameter. It should be noted that EM-PF is for initial PMT and model parameter estimation, while Kalman filter is for online PMT estimation ensuring computation-efficiency and realtime capability. Our approach is validated with both numerical and experimental investigations.},

abstract = {—This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of per-manent magnet synchronous machine stator winding impedance variation in inter-turn short-circuit and eccentricity faults. The phase impedances are monitored through an extended self-commissioning procedure at the standstill mode before or after operation, and hence are agnostic to well-known issues caused by transients, load/speed level, or controller coefficient dependency. Moreover, the effect of stator iron core saturation on the electri-cal parameters is analyzed in depth. In order to distinguish the inter-turn shorts from the eccentricity fault which exhibits simi-lar behaviors, a classification algorithm based on the saturation effect is introduced and analyzed on the machines with different pole–slot combinations. Both two-dimensional finite element anal-ysis simulation and experimental test results are provided to show the efficacy of this analysis. Index Terms—Eccentricity fault, electrical parameter, inter-turn short-circuit fault, magnetic saturation, permanent magnet syn-chronous machines (PMSMs).},

abstract = {—This (patent-pending) paper presents a new method for detection of rotor winding intercoil short circuits of syn-chronous machines and slip rings induction machines, as well as rupture of rotor bars and cage ring of induction machines. It is based on differential measurement of magnetic field by using two measuring coils. Measuring the coil-induced voltage enables us to detect rotor winding faults, which means that measured voltage is approximately zero without fault and increases in the presence of fault. Analysis of the measuring signal enables us to detect and locate fault. This new method enables rotor winding fault detection with high sensitivity, which enables more reliable fault detection. In comparison with the motor current signature analysis method, this new method gives 200 times higher sensitivity to fault occur-rence. Numerous finite-element (FE) simulations have been carried out to verify the method. Also, this method was experimentally validated via series of laboratory tests on the specially designed electric machines for fault study (broken rotor bars, broken ring and intercoil short circuit in a rotor winding). Additionally, this method is applied on more than 20 real machines in industry. This patent-pending method is already implemented in three innovative products placed on market, so this method is fully confirmed in practice.},

abstract = {F AULT diagnosis of electric machines, power electronics, and drives has been the object of a significant amount of re-search work during the last few decades. Reducing maintenance costs and preventing unscheduled downtimes, which cause pro-duction and economic losses, are a priority for manufacturers and operators. Correct diagnosis and early detection of incipi-ent faults lead to reduce maintenance costs and downtime for the process under consideration, and in many cases also prevent harmful and sometimes disruptive failures. Moreover, the comprehension of the fault occurrence con-ditions, and the failure detection and location, are the starting point for the study of effective fault-tolerant techniques, since the latter must always include failure detection, isolation of failed component, and component reconfiguration. This Special Issue on Fault Diagnosis of Electric Machines, Power Electronics, and Drives aims to offer an insight into the state-of-the-art of diagnostics and condition monitoring of elec-trical machines, power electronics, adjustable speed drives, and related areas. One hundred papers were received for this Special Issue, from which 54 papers were accepted for publication. The papers are divided into six groups, covering the following topics: 1) electrical machines including induction motor faults (sta-tor windings, air gap, rotor cage, and bearings), permanent magnet synchronous machine faults (interturn, phase-to-phase, or phase-to-ground short circuits, and demag-netization), multiphase permanent magnet assisted syn-chronous reluctance motor faults, and transformers turn-to-turn faults; 2) power electronics including fault-tolerant T-type multi-level inverters, modular multilevel converters for HVdc transmission networks, grid side converters for intercon-necting renewable energy sources, interleaved boost dc– dc converters for solar photovoltaic systems, silicon-based IGBTs, SiC MOSFET power modules, and electrostatic discharge testing; 3) electrical drives including permanent magnet syn-chronous motor drives failures (IGBTs, current sensors, windings insulation, and mechanical shaft), ac motor drive as a diagnostic sensor of gear faults, open-switch faults in T-type inverter-fed induction motor drives, fault-tolerant position sensor controller for switched reluctance motor Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/TIA.2017.2688758 This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology under Project SFRH/BSAB/118741/2016. drives, and high resistance grounding faults in adjustable speed drive systems; 4) tools for diagnostics including phaselet transform, wavelet transform, multiresolution wavelet packet decomposition, winding function approach; multiscale filtering spectrum, hypothesis testing, support vector machine, large memory storage retrieval neural networks, AdaBoost algorithm, multivariate quality control charts, high-dimensional fea-ture reduction, and higher order lumped parameter thermal networks; 5) materials for electrical machines including insulation ma-terials (accelerated aging, partial discharges, polarization current, and lifetime estimation), and retaining rings; 6) predictive maintenance including synchronous genera-tors, electric submersible pumps, diesel engine driven generators, and reliability-centered maintenance.},

abstract = {—Bearing is one of the most critical components in most electrical and power drives. Effective bearing fault diagnosis is im-portant for keeping the electrical and power drives safe and oper-ating normally. In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, massive real-time data are collected from bearing health monitor-ing systems. Mechanical big data have the characteristics of large volume, diversity, and high velocity. There are two major problems in using the existing methods for bearing fault diagnosis with big data. The features are manually extracted relying on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic ex-pertise, and the used models have shallow architectures, limiting their capability in fault diagnosis. Effectively mining features from big data and accurately identifying the bearing health conditions with new advanced methods have become new issues. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for bearing fault diag-nosis. The presented approach preprocesses sensor signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Based on a simple spectrum matrix obtained by STFT, an optimized deep learning structure, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network, is built to diagnose the bearing faults. Acoustic emission signals ac-quired from a bearing test rig are used to validate the presented method. The validation results show the accurate classification per-formance on various bearing faults under different working condi-tions. The performance of the presented method is also compared with other effective bearing fault diagnosis methods reported in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the pre-sented method gives much better diagnostic performance, even at relatively low rotating speeds.

abstract = {—A line-start interior permanent magnet (LSIPM) motor operates with inherent hunting phenomena. This paper presents a novel procedure for real-time diagnosis of hunting in LSIPM motors based on stator current signatures. Torsional vi-bration associated with hunting in a LSIPM motor influences the electrical supply, and introduces variable amplitude lower and up-per sidebands in the stator current. In this paper, wavelet packet decomposition is applied to perform multiresolution analysis of the nonstationary current signals for detection and extraction of the sideband frequency components superimposed on the funda-mental. Statistical techniques are applied on the extracted data signals and a signature for the diagnosis of hunting phenomenon is established. The proposed technique is validated by performing finite element analysis (FEA) of two three-phase four-pole LSIPM motors of different power ratings for various case scenarios. Ex-perimental investigations have been carried out for a three-phase four-pole 208-V, 1-HP LSIPM motor drive in order to validate the performance of the proposed method under various operating conditions. Based on FEA and experimental results, the proposed technique can successfully diagnose the hunting phenomenon with-out a vibration sensor.

abstract = {—Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) based de-tection of rotor cage faults (RFs) in medium-high voltage induction motors has become common in the field due to its low-cost remote monitoring capability. However, low-frequency load oscillations (LOs) in applications that employ speed reduction couplings can induce frequency components in the vicinity of that of RFs. It has been reported that false-positive or -negative RF indications can be produced with the MCSA, if the frequency components produced by RF and LO overlap. There, recently, have been studies on dis-criminating RF and LO; however, the case where two harmonic components overlap at the same frequency, which is the most dif-ficult and serious case, has not been investigated. In this paper, a spectrum analysis of instantaneous active and reactive power is applied, and it is shown that RF and LO can be separated for the case where the MCSA fails due to the overlap in the two spectral components. An experimental study performed on a 380 V motor with a speed reduction gear shows that RF and LO can be reliably detected and separated for avoiding false RF indications.

This paper proposes a novel online magnet flux-linkage estimation approach by using measured speed harmonics. The proposed approach is based on the PMSM's mechanical equa-tion, so it is not influenced by magnetic saturation, inverter non-linearity, and changes in machine parameters. The interaction of magnet flux linkage and harmonic current can produce torque harmonic, and thus speed harmonic. Therefore, we explore the use of speed harmonic for magnet flux-linkage estimation. At first, the torque and speed harmonic models are proposed. Then, the mathematical relationship between magnet flux linkage and speed harmonic is developed. Based on this model, a novel magnet flux-linkage estimation approach is proposed, which can eliminate the influence of the cogging torque and spatial harmonics in magnet flux-linkage estimation. The proposed approach is validated on a PMSM drive system under different loads and speeds.},

abstract = {—This paper investigates a new fault detection method for induction machines diagnosis. The proposed detection method is based on hypothesis testing. The decision is made between two hypotheses: the machine is healthy and the machine is faulty. The generalized likelihood ratio test is used to address this issue with un-known signal and noise parameters. To implement this detector, the unknown parameters are replaced by their estimates. Specifically, four estimations are required, which are model order, frequency, phase, and amplitude estimations. The model order is obtained using the Bayesian information criterion. Total least-squares esti-mation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques is used to estimate frequencies. Then, phases and amplitudes are obtained using the least-squares estimator. The proposed approach performance is assessed using simulation data by plotting the re-ceiver operating characteristic curves. Two faults are considered: bearing and broken rotor bar faults. Experimental tests clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed detector.

abstract = {—This paper presents the design, implementation, and experimental validation of a method for fault prognosis for power electronics systems using an adaptive parameter identification ap-proach. The adaptive parameter identifier uses a generalized gra-dient descent algorithm to compute real-time estimates of system parameters (e.g., capacitance, inductance, parasitic resistance) in arbitrary switching power electronics systems. These estimates can be used to monitor the overall health of a power electronics system and to predict when faults are more likely to occur. Moreover, the estimates can be used to tune control loops that rely on the system parameter values. The parameter identification algorithm is gen-eral in that it can be applied to a broad class of systems based on switching power converters. We present a real-time experimental validation of the proposed fault prognosis method on a 3 kW solar photovoltaic interleaved boost dc–dc converter system for tracking changes in passive component values. The proposed fault progno-sis method enables a flexible and scalable solution for condition monitoring and fault prediction in power electronics systems.},

abstract = {—Condition monitoring of induction motors is impor-tant for their efficient and reliable operation. Most of the existing electrical techniques of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are based on current, voltage, vibration, or/and flux measurements external to the motor. This paper proposes an online fault diagnos-tic system, which is based on measurements of internal main air gap flux density of an induction motor by an array of Hall effect flux sensors. Such an instrumentation is justified for large specialized induction motors with particularly high-reliability requirements. Fundamental theory behind the air gap flux density as a function of time and space, and its distortions introduced by various faults, is reviewed in this paper. Based on this theory, this paper pro-poses a comprehensive condition monitoring approach to diagnose induction motor faults including stator turn-to-turn shorts, rotor bar damage, and static and dynamic eccentricity, which may be present individually or at the same time. Moreover, the proposed approach not only detects each fault at its early stage but also de-termines its exact location and severity. The principles proposed in this paper are illustrated by extensive simulations and are ex-perimentally validated on a prototype online condition monitoring system based on National Instruments real-time platform.

abstract = {—High-resistance grounding (HRG) is preferred in many industrial applications where the operation continuity is critical under ground fault conditions, such as pulp, paper, oil refining, chemical, glass, and metal industries. This is due to: 1) continuity of service; 2) minimized productivity impact with the scheduled system downtime; and 3) improved safety concerns— elimination of phase to ground arc flash hazards, suppression of transient line to ground overvoltages, and minimization of the equipment damage at the point of ground fault. However, there are also some drawbacks in accurately detecting and locating a ground fault in adjustable speed drive (ASD) systems: 1) the HRG fault current (1–10 A) cannot reliably trip the overcurrent protection function in drives; 2) the existing methods are based on the line volt-age/frequency (50/60 Hz), making it hard to detect and locate low-voltage/low-frequency ground faults; and 3) with the existing meth-ods, the possible fault locations will be manually checked one by one using an Ammeter by a trained technician. This paper will present a flux linkage detection based HRG fault identification method for ASD systems. The proposed method can solve: 1) reliable HRG fault detection with wide motor speed range; 2) the HRG fault can be easily identified in multiple systems; and 3) the identification process is performed by the proposed system diagnosis method, no trained technician is required during the identification process.},

abstract = {—Accurate and continuous rotor position information is essential for switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives operating in variable speed drive applications. To increase the SRM drives re-liability regarding position sensor failures, an active position sensor fault-tolerant controller is presented in this paper. The proposed approach uses two sensorless methods and a position sensor with a maximum-likelihood voting algorithm. The rotor position is esti-mated from the sensorless method in case of position sensor fault, by an improved pulse injection method in the current-chopping-control mode in a low-speed operation and a current-gradient method in the single-pulse-control mode in a high-speed opera-tion. Through the analysis of the fault position signals of SRM, a new fault diagnosis method of position signals based on the predic-tions of the edges is adopted in this paper.

abstract = {—Retaining rings are an important, and the most highly stressed, component of the entire turbogenerator system. Arcing in retaining rings is a very serious problem as it can easily escalate to a full-blown failure. In this paper, we investigate this arcing problem in the retaining rings. We determine the most likely mechanism by which arcing occurs and the type of events that lead to it. Specifi-cally, we try to test two different mechanisms that could have led to the indications of arc. The first one is sparking due to high field ef-fects (or high voltage gradient across the contact junction) and the other is a make-and-break contact arcing owing to the presence of inductance in the system. Experiments performed to measure the contact resistance between the retaining ring and mild iron piece indicate that even very high fault currents cannot produce enough voltage drop to cause sparking. Transient three-dimensional finite-element simulations show that a break in a relatively small contact region, which can be part of a bigger contact area, can generate localized voltage spikes that are high enough to lead to arcing. Inter-estingly, this can happen at relatively low currents. Furthermore, hardware experiments in the laboratory confirm the possibility of generation of arcs due to a make-and-break contact at low currents.},

abstract = {—Fault diagnosis of the bearings in direct-drive (i.e., no gearbox) wind turbines is a challenging issue due to the varying shaft rotating frequency (SRF) caused by the erratic wind environ-ment. To remove the spectrum smearing phenomena of the SRF-related components and the disturbances of the SRF-unrelated components in a measured signal, this paper proposes a novel method, called multiscale filtering spectrum (MFS), to obtain the weighted energy distribution of the monocomponent signals within a local order range based on the Vold-Kalman filter (VKF). First, the instantaneous SRF of the wind turbine is estimated from a gen-erator current signal. Then, a VKF-based multiscale filter bank is designed according to the center frequencies corresponding to the SRF at different scales. The monocomponent signals whose fre-quencies are continuous multipliers of the SRF are subsequently extracted from the envelope of the measured current or vibration signal. Finally, a weighted energy spectrum is constructed within the selected order range, from which possible bearing fault charac-teristic orders can be identified. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed new MFS method can enhance the char-acteristic orders and suppress the noise, and therefore has better performance than the traditional angular resampling method for bearing fault diagnosis of direct-drive wind turbines under varying speed conditions.

The feature extraction and dimensionality re-duction are useful preprocessing steps to obtain high performance in condition monitoring schemes. To address this issue, this work presents a novel diagnosis methodology based on high-dimensional feature reduction applied to detect multiple faults in an induction motor linked to a kinematic chain. The proposed methodology in-volves a hybrid feature reduction that ensures a good processing of the acquired vibration signals. The method is performed se-quentially. First, signal decomposition is carried out by means of empirical mode decomposition. Second, statistical-time-based fea-tures are estimated from the resulting decompositions. Third, a feature optimization is performed to preserve the data variance by a genetic algorithm in conjunction with the principal component analysis. Fourth, a feature selection is done by means of Fisher score analysis. Fifth, a feature extraction is performed through linear discriminant analysis. And, finally, sixth, the different con-sidered faults are diagnosed by a Neural Network-based classifier. The performance and the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis methodology is validated experimentally and compared with classi-cal feature reduction strategies, making the proposed methodology suitable for industry applications.

When using the state-of-the-art motor drive-based techniques for extracting spatial information related to the state of wear in a gear train driven by an ac machine, po-sition sensor-induced periodic position measurement errors and machine-induced spatial harmonic torque ripple can degrade the quality and the detail of the information that can be extracted. In this work, this degradation of information is displayed exper-imentally, and it is demonstrated that the quality of the spatial information extracted can be significantly improved through im-plementation of existing model reference adaptive system (MRAS)-based nonideal sensor property decoupling techniques and newly developed MRAS-based spatial harmonic torque ripple decoupling techniques. Furthermore, it is identified and demonstrated in this work that by removing the gear mesh harmonic component from the gear wear information extracted using the state-of-the-art tech-niques, and then calculating the spatial rate of change of this new information, a new signal is generated that strongly correlates to local gear tooth defects in a gear train driven by an ac machine.

abstract = {—A considerable amount of papers has been published in recent years proposing supervised classifiers to diagnose the health of a machine. The usual procedure with these classifiers is to train them using data acquired through controlled experi-ments, expecting them to perform well on new data, classifying correctly the condition of a motor. But, obviously, the new motor to be diagnosed cannot be the same that has been used during the training process; it may be a motor with different characteristics and fed from a completely different source. These different condi-tions between the training process and the testing one can deeply influence the diagnosis. To avoid these drawbacks, in this paper, a new method is proposed, which is based on robust statistical techniques applied in quality control applications. The proposed method is based on the online diagnosis of the operating motor and can detect deviations from the normal operational conditions. A robust approach has been implemented using high-breakdown statistical techniques, which can reliably detect anomalous data that often cause an unexpected overestimation of the data vari-ability, reducing the ability of standard procedures to detect faulty conditions in earlier stages. A case study is presented to prove the validity of the proposed approach. Motors of different character-istics, fed from the power line and several different inverters, are tested. Three different fault conditions are provoked: a broken bar, a faulty bearing, and mixed eccentricity. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach can detect incipient faults.},

There are different methods for detecting the stator slot with a PG fault, which have practically been used for many years. These methods have some drawbacks such as further damages to the faulty generator, low accuracy, re-quiring expensive equipment, and taking long time for detection. This paper introduces a novel strategy for realizing a stator slot with the PG fault which can be used in large generators. This strategy can be easily implemented, and it is able to detect the fault location precisely. Based on this strategy, three different methods are proposed and their performances are investigated using a sim-ulation based on the finite elements method.

abstract = {—Electrical signature analysis (ESA) has been success-fully applied to predictive maintenance of synchronous machines. The fault diagnosis is performed by analyzing failure patterns in the current or voltage spectra, which allow the discrimination of a healthy and a faulty condition on the monitored machine. Gener-ally, the failure patterns are a function of the line frequency, rotor rotation frequency, and some structure features of the machine. The rotor rotation frequency pattern, for instance, is indicative of rotor mechanical problems and rotor winding interturn short-circuit. An increase of this frequency component magnitude may indicate the incipience of a rotor fault but may not discriminate the nature of the fault (electrical or mechanical). Thus, it is nec-essary to distinguish the effects of electrical and mechanical faults in these components in order to get a reliable diagnosis of the ma-chine. No works have been found in the literature approaching this specific issue. This paper proposes a simple and innovative method-ology to distinguish the effect of electrical and mechanical faults in the mentioned ESA failure patterns based on the method of sym-metrical components.

abstract = {The in-field validation of wind turbines behavior is very time consuming and cost intensive, especially when fault ride-through (FRT) tests are conducted. Full-size wind-turbine test benches allow a realistic operation of wind turbines in an artificial environment. Due to the independency of wind and grid conditions, the cost and duration of the test program and certification can be reduced. This paper presents the development of 4 MW full-size wind-turbine test bench following a multi-physics hardware in-the-loop (HiL) concept. With the currently installed test bench setup, a synchronization of the device-under-test converters is possible. Through the measurement results of the test programs conducted on the test bench, the capability of the test bench in replicating the field conditions is demonstrated. In addition, a time consuming efficiency measurement can be performed with the reduced duration on the test bench. This shows another main benefit of the test bench compared to the conventional test method for wind turbines. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

Among all the components of the induction motor, bearing is the critical component and the fault occurring in it has to be considered as a major issue. Usually, the bearing fault can be detected by the vibrational analysis. However, this method has a disadvantage that location of the equipment is not always easily accessible, and also it is quite costly. Thus, in this paper, an experiment for detecting the fault in the bearing of a three phase induction motor is achieved by the frequency selec-tion in the stator-current spectrum.

Experimental results were obtained considering two types of outer raceway bearing faults at different load conditions and promising results were obtained.},

Accordingly, this paper presents a robust fault diagnostic method for multiple insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) open-circuit faults and current sensor faults in three-phase PMSM drives. The proposed observer-based algo-rithm relies on an adaptive threshold for fault diagnosis. Current sensor and open-circuit faults can be distinguished and the faulty sensors and/or power semiconductors are effectively isolated.

Accurate modeling and sim-ulation of the faulty machines can help to design effective condition monitoring systems. Three-phase synchronous machines (TSMs) are widely used for electrical power generation at power plants. Winding function theory offers effective, quick, and rather simple method for modeling and simulation of faulty electrical machines; however, this method only includes real windings of the machine. Rotor damping effects have important role in dynamic perfor-mance of the TSMs. Fictitious short-circuited windings (damper windings) on the rotor direct and quadrature axes are used to model these effects in the Park's vector model. This paper offers an approach to include similar damper windings in the winding function approach for modeling TSMs with interturn fault in the stator winding. Simulation results show creation or amplification of some frequency components in the stator line current as well as the rotor field current due to the interturn fault whose frequen-cies are equal to the rotor speed and its integer multiples. The frequency components are also present in the circulating fault cur-rent within the shorted turns. Experimental results approve the simulation results.

The monitored parameters include temperature and vibration of the motor, and the pump intake pressure. Transmitting these parameters successfully and reliably through a downhole tool from downhole to surface under various ESP system operating conditions is critical for production opti-mization and equipment safety. In this paper, a new downhole tool design method using a phase-to-neutral communication scheme is proposed, which can overcome issues of current downhole tool products installed in the field. In this design, an effective signal com-munication path is formed by external impedance on the wellhead connecting one phase to the ground combined with a controlled thyristor at downhole connecting the neutral of an electrical sub-mersible motor to the ground. Extensive analytical calculation and PSCAD simulation of the proposed method are demonstrated in the paper. Two case studies are conducted using a real ESP sys-tem under normal and single-line-to-ground fault conditions. A sensitivity study is performed to evaluate the influence of various factors on the signal strength for signal communication purpose. A lab testing further provides proof of concept.

A novel on-line nonintrusive diagnostic method for detecting open-circuit switch faults in silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs)-based T-type multilevel converters is introduced in this paper. The principle of this method is based on monitoring the abnormal vari-ations of the dc-bus neutral-point current in combination with the existing information on instantaneous switching states and phase currents. Advantages of this method include faster detection speed and simpler implementation compared to other existing diagnos-tic methods in the literature. Moreover, this diagnostic method is immune to the disturbances of inverter's dc-bus voltage unbalance and load unbalance. In this method, only one additional current sensor is required for measuring the dc-bus neutral-point current; therefore, the implementation cost is low. Simulation and experi-mental results based on a lab-scale 20 kVA adjustable speed drive with a three-level SiC T-type inverter validate the effectiveness and robustness of this novel diagnostic method.

abstract = {—Intelligent fault detection in induction motors (IMs) is a widely studied research topic. Various artificial-intelligence-based approaches have been proposed to deal with a large amount of data obtained from destructive laboratory testing. However, in real applications, such volume of data is not always available due to the effort required in obtaining the predictors for classifying the faults. Therefore, in realistic scenarios, it is necessary to cope with the small-data problem, as it is known in the literature. Fault-related instances along with healthy state observations obtained from the IM compose datasets that are usually imbalanced, where the number of instances classified as the faulty class (minority) is much lower than those classified under the healthy class (ma-jority). This paper presents a novel supervised classification ap-proach for IM faults based on the adaptive boosting algorithm with an optimized sampling technique that deals with the imbal-anced experimental dataset. The stator current signal is used to compose a dataset with features both from the time domain and from the frequency domain. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher performance metrics than others classifiers used in this field for the incipient detection and classification of faults in IM.},

In low power motors, the insulation degradation is principally due to the steep voltage variations caused by the voltage source converters that drive the machines. In the last years, with the coming to market of new no-Si based power devices, which achieve great values of dv/dt, fast tracking of electrical fault has became a topic of primary importance. In this paper, a new method to detect the presence of incipient faults in ultrareliable electric machines is presented and compared with a previous solution. The different methods were extensively evaluated by means of experimental results. It is shown that potential winding faults can be detected at an early stage of fault inception and thus measures can be taken to limit propagation.

This inverter topology provides a fault-tolerant solution to any open-circuit and certain short-circuit switching faults in the power devices. During any of the fault-tolerant operation modes for these device faults, there is no derating required in the inverter output voltage or output power. In addition, overload capability is increased in this new T-type inverter compared to that in the conventional three-level T-type inverter. Such increase in inverter overload capability is due to the utilization of the redundant leg for overload current sharing with other main phase legs under healthy condition. Moreover, if the redundant phase leg is composed of silicon carbide metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors, quasi-zero-voltage switching, and zero-current switching of the silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) in the conventional main phase legs can be achieved at certain switching states, which can significantly relieve the thermal stress on the outer IGBTs and improve the whole inverter efficiency. Simulation and experimental results are given to verify the efficacy and merits of this high-performance fault-tolerant T-type inverter topology. Index Terms—Fault-tolerant operation, load current sharing, Si/SiC hybrid phase legs, soft switching, T-type inverter.},

abstract = {—The effects of leakage-biased voltage (V L B) levels are investigated in this paper, which are set for failure-mode iden-tification on the final fault diagnostic measurement in transmis-sion line pulse (TLP) testing. To identify the effect on electrostatic discharge (ESD) robustness, three types of MOSFET components were employed; namely, low-voltage n-channel MOSFET (LVn-MOS) (5 V/0.6 µm), high-voltage n-channel MOSFET (HVnMOS), and high-voltage p-channel MOSFET (HVpMOS) (12 V/1.8 µm) devices under test (DUTs), respectively. After a series of system-atic TLP measurements, this study determined that the set V L B level substantially influenced the failure mode identification and I t2 value decision on the LVnMOS and HVnMOS DUTs, but its effect on the HVpMOS DUT was extremely weak. According to the secondary breakdown current (I t2) values, the error caused by a maximum V L B level was up to 55.6{\%} in the LVnMOS DUT, 81{\%} in the HVnMOS DUT, and only 3.38{\%} in the HVpMOS DUT. Con-sequently, this engendered a considerable deviation in most data derived from testing DUTs through TLP compared with those de-rived from a human-body model (HBM). Hence, to ensure a high correlation between values measured through TLP testing and an HBM for the same DUTs, the V L B level should be considered during TLP testing. The lack of correlation is demonstrated to be due to a moderate soft and hard failure during TLP measurement especially for the LVnMOS and HVnMOS samples. Therefore, to obtain accurate I t2 values for DUTs, the V L B level for the failure-mode identification in TLP testing should be within a low-biasing range (such as kept V L B ࣘ 5 V). Index Terms—Failure-mode identification, human-body model (HBM), leakage-biasing voltage, secondary breakdown current, transmission-line-pulse, trigger voltage.},

abstract = {—To develop a reliable permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) controller for electric vehicle application, detec-tion of permanent-magnet (PM) demagnetization conditions is of significance. This paper explores the use of torque ripple for on-line PM demagnetization fault diagnosis using continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) and grey system theory (GST). First, a torque-ripple-based rotor flux linkage detection model considering electro-magnetic noises is proposed, which employs CWT filtering, wavelet ridge spectrum, and torque ripple energy extraction. This model is able to reveal the torque variation and eliminate the effect of elec-tromagnetic interferences. Second, GST is employed to facilitate the detection of demagnetization ratios and torque ripple energy pulsations caused by demagnetization. Third, a current regulation strategy is proposed to minimize the torque ripples induced by PM demagnetization, which contributes to making the approach feasi-ble to interior PMSM (IPMSM). Furthermore, the proposed real-time irreversible demagnetization detection approach can identify the demagnetization fault under different operating conditions. The proposed approach and current regulation strategy are exper-imentally verified on a down-scaled laboratory IPMSM.

abstract = {—In this study, a signal-based predictive fault-detection approach is developed to identify potential faults within an elec-tric motor. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, first artificial motor vibration data are produced and used as a base line for analysis and assessment of the methodology. After successfully confirming proof of concept by detecting all fault frequencies hidden within the artificial data, the approach is then applied to the experimental data to see whether it can be accepted as a suitable potential fault detection tool for healthy electric mo-tors. As the keystone of the study, algebraic summation operation (ASO) is introduced for predictive fault detection. ASO is built and based upon the redundant nature of stationary wavelet transform (SWT). Although similar to the SWT, the down sampling operation defined for the perfect reconstruction of SWT is omitted in ASO to amplify the redundancy within the transform. In other words, the redundancy obtained during decomposition is conserved on purpose with the goal of amplifying potential fault frequencies in electric motor vibration spectra and allowing for more robust and predictive fault detection.},

The operation of the GSC is properly regulated by the GSC controller according to sensor measurements (i.e., of the grid voltage, of the line currents, and of the voltage at the dc-link). However, in case of current sensor faults, the operation of the GSC and of the entire renewable system can be critically affected and catastrophic failures may occur if the sensor fault is not accommodated on time. This paper proposes a model-based Fault Detection, Isolation, and Accommodation (FDIA) scheme, which enables the GSC to overcome faults that may occur on the associated current sensors. The sensor fault detection and isola-tion scheme has been designed based on analytical redundancy relations, while the accommodation of the faults is based on an adaptive estimation scheme. The proposed FDIA scheme has been applied on a modern GSC and the effectiveness of the scheme has been tested under several multiple current sensor faults and under several grid conditions. Furthermore, the FDIA scheme enables the GSC to operate properly (without causing failures or damages to its components) under current sensor faults and thus, the reliability of the GSC is enhanced.},

The system is based on the use of a feedforward multilayer perception artificial neural network (ANN) performed by the back-propagation training algorithm. From a thorough study and analysis of the behavior of the negative-sequence voltage of the machine under different stator faults and different operating conditions, two new robust indicators of faults are selected as the ANN inputs. The two fault indicators are the phase angle of the negative sequence voltage and the frequency of the machine voltages. After successfully training and testing the ANN with specific and meaningful databases, the ANN behavior is validated by using an experimental database acquired from a real machine. The accurate results provided by the ANN prove the reliability of the proposed system to automatically diagnose different stator faults under variable speed, variable fault current, and variable load conditions overcoming different disturbances, such as the noisy signals and the harmonics in the machine.

@article{Mancinelli2017,
abstract = {—This paper is focused on the reliability evaluation of an electric vehicle (EV) motor based on hairpin technology. Be-sides bearings (not discussed here), the weak point of an electric motor is its insulating system. For inverter-fed motors, the incep-tion of partial discharges might lead to failure in a matter of days, and thus, deserves particular attention. Qualification and lifetime evaluation of inverter-fed machines are described in IEC 60034-18-41, which specifies accelerated aging procedures and considers partial discharge inception as the end-of-life criterion. This stan-dard was used as a reference for this paper. The only exception is that insulation models were subjected to the mechanical stress pro-file reported in the ISO 16750-3-2012 standard since an automotive motor is subject to significant vibrations during its operation. From the tests performed, we observed that, with the hairpin technology, turn-to-turn is the weakest link in the insulation system. All the insulation models were partial discharge (PD) free from the begin-ning of the tests to breakdown and the root cause for breakdown was, in all cases, traced back to cracks on the surface of the insula-tion. This suggests that, depending on insulating enamel thickness and conductor geometry, some insulation systems are intrinsically PD free by design, despite the effect of aging. Considering the se-vere vibration profiles typical of EVs, and the principal breakdown mechanism (cracking of the insulation), mechanical stress coupled with thermal stress appears as the main aging driver. Therefore, this paper spotlights the lack of proper standards for the quali-fication of automotive electric motors and hints at the possibility that IEC 60034-18-41 considers dealing with motors that might be intrinsically partial discharge free even after long-term exposure to operational stresses.},

The capacitor degradation process, which remarkably depends from the temperature experienced by the component, is typically monitored by observing the capacitor Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR). However, the ESR measurement is influenced by the temperature at which the measurement is performed, which changes depending on the operating conditions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel degradation indicator independent from the measurement temperature. Such indicator can, then, be used for the prediction of the capacitor degradation and its RUL. For this, we develop a Particle Filter prognostic model, whose performance is verified on data collected in simulated and experimental degradation tests.},

abstract = {The solar energy generation has grown significantly in the past years. The importance of PV penetration in power system as a major element of renewable energy source has seen it being widely used on a global scale. Despite its promising success, PV penetration presents various issues and its impact on the distribution system has to address for seamless integration in the power system. In this paper, a comprehensive overview on important issues affecting the distribution system as a result of PV penetration is presented. Pertinent issues such as voltage fluctuation, voltage rise, voltage balance, and harmonics and their effect on the system are discussed in details. The islanding issues, which are of critical importance to the stability and integrity of the system, are also thoroughly reviewed. Details on different islanding techniques - remote and local techniques and their advantage and disadvantages are shown. Therefore, this paper can provide useful information and serve as a reference for researchers and utility engineers on issues to be considered with regards to PV penetration.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for comparing thermal energy storage to electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical energy storage technologies. The underlying physics of this model is hinged on the development of a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, sodium sulphur, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100's of MWh. The rationale behind this analysis was to develop an electrical storage efficiency for molten salt thermal energy storage systems, such that it can be compared to battery energy storage technologies in the context of comparing CSP with thermal energy storage to solar photovoltaic with battery storage from a utility scale perspective. The results from the modelling using Andasol 3 CSP plant as a case study yield a storage efficiency of 86{\%} and LCOE of {\$}216/MWh. The results of this modelling will facilitate the future generation of a thermal energy storage roadmap.},

The complex task of PMSM control in high-performance applications is currently usually resolved with classical vector control. Modern control techniques such as model predictive control can provide significant benefits over field oriented control, especially with straightforward controller tuning and constraints handling. Unfortunately, these new algorithms usually suffer from problems with their computational complexity. In the current paper, we present a PMSM control method based on an explicit model predictive control with a novel linearization and constraints handling method, allowing natural field weakening. The algorithm was designed with respect to computationally feasible implementation in the control hardware. The proposed control algorithm has been proved and successfully verified in both simulation and implementation on a real motor.},

MPC offers many advantages over more traditional control techniques such as the ability to avoid cascaded control loops, easy inclusion of constraint, and fast transient response. On the other hand, the controller computational burden increases exponentially with the system complexity and may result in an unfeasible realization on modern digital control boards. This paper proposes a novel distributed MPC (DMPC), which is able to achieve the same performance of the classical MPC while reducing the computational requirements of its implementation. The proposed control approach is tested on a ac/ac converter in a back-to-back configuration used for power flow management. Simulation results are provided and validated through experimental testing in several operating conditions.},

The grating-polarizer is employed to convert the polarization plane's rotation of a linearly polarized light into the rotation of a circular facula, which then be converted into the horizontal linear movement of a linear facula by an image converter. Thus, a Faraday rotation angle can be measured directly by positioning the dark stripe in the facula. A 110-kV prototype with the rated current 300 A is completed, and trail run on the line.

The dead-beat control has good transient response, but it suffers from parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. In order to provide robustness, a discrete-time integral term is added to the dead-beat current prediction. The stability analysis is carried out considering the prediction error dynamics, nonlinear uncertain model of PMSM, and the integral action as the states of the overall system. The designed robust predictive controller is tested through numerical simulations and experiments. The proposed controller is easy to implement and suitable for high-performance PMSM applications.},

abstract = {In this study, the control objectives such as maximum power point tracking (MPPT), synchronisation with grid and current control are realised for single-stage utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) system which is also capable of injecting the reactive power into the grid. For utility-scale PV system, the single-stage scheme is used for high efficiency and simple power converter topology. The proposed MPPT approach utilising a modified particle swarm optimisation method is interrelated with other control schemes. The MPP changes with variation in solar irradiation and temperature. Also, the PV power characteristic of large system is characterised by multiple peaks under partial shaded condition. The conventional methods such as hill climbing and incremental conductance methods do not work properly in these conditions. The proposed method is suitable to all conditions with reduced steady-state fluctuations. The overall system is simulated in PSCAD and the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on various conditions. {\&}copy; The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

abstract = {The cost reduction of power electronic devices, the increase in their reliability, efficiency and power capability, lower development times, together with more demanding application requirements, have driven the development of several new inverter topologies recently introduced in industry, particularly mediumvoltage converters. New more complex inverter topologies and new application fields come along with additional control challenges, such as: voltage imbalances, power quality issues, higher efficiency needs and fault tolerant operation, which necessarily requires the parallel development of modulation schemes. Therefore, recently there have been significant advances in the field of modulation of dc/ac converters, which conceptually has been dominated during the last several decades almost exclusively by classic pulse width modulation methods. This paper aims to concentrate and discuss the latest developments on this exciting technology, to provide insight on where the state-of-the-art stands today, and analyze the trends and challenges driving its future.},

The proposed MPVC and MPCC methods are able to solve the cross regulation problem, which is a critical issue in SIMO DC-DC converters. The design of the proposed methods using augmented state-space models, cost functions and constraints for SIMO DC-DC converter is discussed. Simulation of the influence of control horizon N C and Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ of the MPVC and MPCC methods is conducted to guide the control parameter setting for hardware implementation. The transient responses to reference variation of the two proposed methods are also presented. Moreover, a single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter hardware prototype is developed and the proposed control methods are implemented. Four test cases are conducted based on this prototype. Simulation and experimental results show that the two proposed methods guarantee low cross regulation for SIMO DC-DC converters and have a fast response speed to reference variations.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new predictive direct torque control (DTC) method is proposed, which improves the dynamic response of the conventional DTC in the transient state and yields the minimum torque and flux ripples in the steady state through an optimal voltage vector. At the steady state, the magnitude, phase, and time duration of the voltage vector are adjusted in a manner where the minimum torque and flux ripples are obtained; whereas in the transient state, the voltage vector parameters are adjusted in a manner where the fastest dynamic response is achieved. The space-vector modulation is used in synthesizing the selected voltage vector where a fixed switching frequency is achieved. In order to improve the control system efficiency, the principle of maximum torque per ampere is adopted in obtaining the commanding stator flux magnitude. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the steady-state and transient-state performances are tested in MATLAB software and in practice. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed method yields the minimum torque and flux ripples while improving the dynamic response of the conventional DTC. The comparative investigation with an existing predictive DTC method indicates that the proposed method has a better performance in both the steady state and transient state.},

abstract = {Capacitors are one type of reliability-critical components in power electronic systems. In the last two decades, many efforts in academic research have been devoted to the condition monitoring of capacitors to estimate their health status. Industry applications are demanding more reliable power electronics products with preventive maintenance. Nevertheless, most of the developed capacitor condition monitoring technologies are rarely adopted by industry due to the complexity, increased cost, and other relevant issues. An overview of the prior-art research in this area is therefore needed to justify the required resources and the corresponding performance of each key method. It serves to provide a guideline for industry to evaluate the available solutions by technology benchmarking, as well as to advance the academic research by discussing the history development and the future opportunities. Therefore, this paper first classifies the capacitor condition monitoring methods into three categories, then the respective technology evolution in the last two decades is summarized. Finally, the state-of-the-art research and the future opportunities targeting for industry applications are given.},

abstract = {The inertia of today's power system decreases as more and more converter connected generation units and load are integrated in the power system. This results in a power system which behaves differently from before which causes concerns for many grid operators. Therefore, a detailed study is needed to investigate the relevance of this inertia in the operation, control and stability of the system. Moreover, a new definition of the term system inertia is necessary since is it expected that in the future also the renewable electricity generation units will deliver the so-called virtual (synthetic) inertia. In this paper a review of the research related to inertia in a power system is given. Both the challenges as the solutions from an operator point of view to control a system with low inertia are discussed. Also a new definition of inertia is proposed to incorporate the different forms of inertia which are each described in more detail. From recent studies, it can be concluded that the influence of reduced inertia on frequency stability is generally considered as the main challenge for system operators, but with the additional measures listed in this paper, this impact can be mitigated.},

They show better performance over Si-IGBTs on renewable energy power conversion systems due to their higher switching frequency, higher temperature capability, higher power density and higher reliability. This paper presents a benchmarking of SiC-MOSFET and Si-IGBT power devices with the voltage rating of 1200V in 2-Level Full-Bridge (2L-FB) inverter for 10kW small scale wind turbine. By simulation, the inverter performance is evaluated in the presence of the wind speed distribution profile and the reference switching frequency value for SiC devices in this topology at this power level is determined. The results show that the SiC solution can improve the efficiency, save energy and reduce the size and cost due to high switching frequency and temperature capabilities.},

The throughput, torque and power are significantly influenced by the vortex motion of the bulk solid being conveyed. The vortex motion, together with the degree of fill, govern the volumetric efficiency and, hence, the throughput. This, in turn, influences the torque, power and conveying efficiency. A theory is presented to predict the performance of screw conveyors of any specified geometry. The influence of the flow properties of the bulk material on the conveyor performance is illustrated.},

@article{VanDeVyver2016,
abstract = {In several countries, the wind power penetration increased tremendously in recent years. To ensure the proper functioning of the power system, some grid operators already require the capability to provide inertial response or primary control with wind turbines. This paper discusses the emulated inertial response with wind turbines by means of the synthetic inertia and the droop control strategy. The behavior of the synthetic inertia strategy is determined by the inertial and the droop constant, whereas droop control only has a droop constant. When these strategies are used, it is important to tune the control parameters depending on the power system to which the wind turbines are connected. Simulations show that it is possible to enhance but also to deteriorate the frequency response of the system, dependent on these parameters. For different power system compositions, the optimal inertial constant is always close to zero. This way, the synthetic inertia strategy reduces to a fast droop control strategy. This is an important outcome, as it means that no differentiation of the frequency is needed to obtain an optimal inertial response from the wind turbines, which is beneficial in terms of robustness. Consequently, droop control is a viable alternative for the synthetic inertia.},

abstract = {The increasing installation of photovoltaic panels in low-voltage grids causes an over voltage problem, especially during high production and low consumption periods. Generally the over voltage problem is overcome by implementing reactive power control methods. The advances in networked control systems theory and practice create new scenarios where reactive power control methods can offer additional features and benefits. To explore these new capabilities, this study presents two new reactive power control methods that exploit the networked approach. These two methods are evaluated in a comparative reference framework that also includes the base-line case where no reactive control method is applied, the conventional droop method approach, and a solution based on a near-optimal location of a high power STATCOM derived from one of the new proposed networked methods. The main merit factors used to compare the control methods are the maximum voltage across the distribution grid, the power factor in the point of common coupling, and the total power losses and economic cost of the installation. With these merit factors, the advantages and limitations of the new and existing control methods are revealed and discussed. A useful discussion for selecting the best control solution is also reported.},

abstract = {Wind energy technology is evolving towards larger machines (longer blades, taller towers and more powerful generators). Scaling up wind turbines is a challenging task, which requires innovative solutions as well as new configurations and de- signs. The size of wind turbines (in terms of rotor diameter, hub height and rated power) has increased extraordinary from 30m rotor diameter, 30m of hub height and 300kW rated power, usual in the late 1980s, to 92.7m rotor diameter, 87.7m of height and 2.1MW on average at the end of 2014. However, technological evolution has not only been focused on the scaling up process but also on developing innovative solutions that minimize costs at the same time as they deal with as- pects of different nature, such as grid code requirements, reliability, quality of the wind resource or prices and availability of certain commodities, among others. This paper analyses the evolution of wind technology from a market-based perspective by identifying trends in the most relevant technological indicators at the same time as stressing the key differentiating aspects between regions/markets. Evo- lution and trends in indicators such as rated power, rotor diameter, hub height, specific power, wind class, drive train con- figuration and power control systems are presented and analysed, showing an intense and fast technological development, which is enabling wind energy to reduce costs and becoming increasingly more competitive with conventional fuel-based generating technologies. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors Wind Energy Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {This study explores the integration issues of next-generation high-penetration photovoltaic (PV) systems, where the grid is becoming more decentralised and vulnerable. In that case, the PV systems are expected to be more controllable with higher efficiency and reliability. Provision of ancillary and intelligent services, such as fault ride-through and reactive power compensation, is the key to attain higher utilisation of solar PV energy. Such functionalities for the future PV inverters can contribute to reduced cost of energy, and thus enable more cost-effective PV installations. To implement the advanced features, a flexible power controller is developed in this study, which can be configured in the PV inverter and flexibly change from one to another mode during operation. Based on the single-phase PQ theory, the control strategy offers the possibilities to generate appropriate references for the inner current control loop. The references depend on system conditions and also specific demands from both system operators and prosumers. Besides, this power control strategy can be implemented in commercial PV inverters as a standardised function, and also the operation modes can be achieved online in predesigned PV inverters. Case studies have verified the effectiveness and flexibilities of the proposal to realise the advanced features.},

For utility-scale PV system, the single-stage scheme is used for high efficiency and simple power converter topology. The proposed MPPT approach utilising a modified particle swarm optimisation method is interrelated with other control schemes. The MPP changes with variation in solar irradiation and temperature. Also, the PV power characteristic of large system is characterised by multiple peaks under partial shaded condition. The conventional methods such as hill climbing and incremental conductance methods do not work properly in these conditions. The proposed method is suitable to all conditions with reduced steady-state fluctuations. The overall system is simulated in PSCAD and the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on various conditions. {\&}copy; The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

@article{Hameer2016,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for comparing thermal energy storage to electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical energy storage technologies. The underlying physics of this model is hinged on the development of a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, sodium sulphur, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100's of MWh. The rationale behind this analysis was to develop an electrical storage efficiency for molten salt thermal energy storage systems, such that it can be compared to battery energy storage technologies in the context of comparing CSP with thermal energy storage to solar photovoltaic with battery storage from a utility scale perspective. The results from the modelling using Andasol 3 CSP plant as a case study yield a storage efficiency of 86{\%} and LCOE of {\$}216/MWh. The results of this modelling will facilitate the future generation of a thermal energy storage roadmap.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology for comparing thermal energy storage to electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical energy storage technologies. The underlying physics of this model is hinged on the development of a round trip efficiency formulation for these systems. The charging and discharging processes of compressed air energy storage, flywheel energy storage, fuel cells, and batteries are well understood and defined from a physics standpoint in the context of comparing these systems. However, the challenge lays in comparing the charging process of these systems with the charging process of thermal energy storage systems for concentrating solar power plants (CSP). The round trip efficiency and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are the metrics used for comparison purposes. The thermal energy storage system is specifically compared to vanadium redox, sodium sulphur, and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems from a large scale storage perspective of 100's of MWh. The rationale behind this analysis was to develop an electrical storage efficiency for molten salt thermal energy storage systems, such that it can be compared to battery energy storage technologies in the context of comparing CSP with thermal energy storage to solar photovoltaic with battery storage from a utility scale perspective. The results from the modelling using Andasol 3 CSP plant as a case study yield a storage efficiency of 86{\%} and LCOE of {\$}216/MWh. The results of this modelling will facilitate the future generation of a thermal energy storage roadmap.},

However, many special design challenges exist for HSEMs. This paper aims to summa-rize and discuss major challenges and design considerations for HSEMs. Solutions to overcome these challenges are also offered in this paper. Four major loss components of HSEMs are dis-cussed and the methods to reduce each loss component are further explained. Bearing options for HSEMs are also compared. In addi-tion, the rotor dynamics and structural challenges are discussed in detail, followed by some design suggestions and considerations. Thermal and cooling challenges are presented as an overview. At the end, the challenges for power electronics circuitry are also demonstrated and are followed by some proposed solutions. Thus, this paper offers a guideline for proper technique selection and the design of HSEMs and associated accessories.},

The scheme consists of a inner predictive torque control, which makes use of the full actuation range provided by a two-level voltage source inverter, although with the use of pulse-widthmodulation. An outer speed controller, based on classical results for the time-optimal control of the double integrator, constitutes a good example application of the proposed torque controller. The overall scheme achieves both fast transient dynamics (as fast as the physics of the system and the control constraints allow) and acceptable steady state performance.},

With criteria such as output power, power factor and torque ripple, the best performing model is selected and a further investigation, regarding the effect of the disk rotor material on the behavior of the machine, is conducted.

abstract = {With increased need for high power density, high efficiency and high temperature capabilities in aerospace and automotive applications, integrated motor drives (IMD) offers a potential solution. However, close physical integration of the converter and the machine may also lead to an increase in components temperature. This requires careful mechanical, structural and thermal analysis; and design of the IMD system. This study reviews existing IMD technologies and their thermal effects on the IMD system. The effects of the power electronics position on the IMD system and its respective thermal management concepts are also investigated. The challenges faced in designing and manufacturing of an IMD along with the mechanical and structural impacts of close physical integration is also discussed and potential solutions are provided. Potential converter topologies for an IMD like the matrix converter, two-level bridge, three-level neutral point clamped and multiphase full bridge converters are also reviewed. Wide band gap devices like silicon carbide and gallium nitride and their packaging in power modules for IMDs are also discussed. Power modules components and packaging technologies are also presented.},

The method is based on minimising a cost function that considers the flux linkage torque harmonics obtained from a discrete-time model of the machine. The power converter witching state that minimises this cost function is selected and applied during a whole sampling period. Additionally it is proposed to mitigate the other source of torque ripple, known as cogging-torque, using a feed-forward signal applied to the torque control loop. A hybrid method, that uses the output information from an observer and look-up table, is presented to obtain a good cogging-torque estimation and thus an accurate mitigation of this disturbance torque at low rotational speed. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the torque ripple compensation methods presented in this paper.},

While many electric vehicles (Evs) are on the market, they are not as cost competitive as conventional vehicles, and affordable cost is necessary for large-scale market penetration. For this to become a reality, continued research is needed to develop new cost-efficient technologies. this article presents the met-rics and benchmarks used to gauge the performance of various electric drive-trains. in addition, current state-of-the-art technologies are presented in terms of these metrics as well as the future goals and trends in the industry. With ongoing january/february 2017  IEEE Industry Applications Magazine 15 development, the market for electric and hybrid vehicles will continue to increase. Automotive Industry Advancements the Ev and hybrid-electric-vehicle (hEv) market has been growing over the years and continues to grow today. influenced by both government regulations and consumer demand, auto manufacturers have continued to pursue technologies to improve efficiency and fuel economy. as the market progresses, continued research and develop-ment are required to enable the large-scale market pene-tration of Evs and hEvs in the future. in particular, there are three main areas in which current research aims to improve the vehicle: electric motors, power electronics, and energy storage. this article describes the evolution of these technologies and lays out the road map for future technological development and implementation in Evs and hEvs [1], [2]. Evs can trace their inception as far back as the early 20th century; however, they were quickly overmatched by the influx of the internal-combustion engine (icE). the advantage that the icE had was its energy-storage capaci-ty; as it was capable of providing longer ranges of travel at a lower fuel cost. however, by the end of the 20th century, technological improvements in electric machines, power electronics, and energy storage sparked increased efforts in Ev development. today, Evs and hEvs have a consider-able share of the automotive marketplace, which is led by major car companies around the world. new technologies will continue to revolutionize the industry and lead to large-scale adaptations of these cars [3], [4]. apart from technology trends, this article will also present perfor-mance requirements that have been set for the future. cur-rent and potential future states of the state-of-the-art technologies will be described, as updated from those dis-cussed in [25].},

abstract = {High penetration of wind generation will increase the requirement for fast frequency response services as currently wind plants do not provide inertial response. Although the importance of inertia reduction has been widely recognized, its impact on the system scheduling has not been fully investigated. In this context, this paper proposes a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for stochastic unit commitment that optimizes system operation by simultaneously scheduling energy production, standing/spinning reserves and inertia-dependent fast frequency response in light of uncertainties associated with wind production and generation outages. Post-fault dynamic frequency requirements, rate of change of frequency, frequency nadir and quasi-steady-state frequency are formulated as MILP constraints by using the simplified model of system dynamics. Moreover the proposed methodology enables the impact of wind uncertainty on system inertia to be considered. Case studies are carried out on the 2030 Great Britain system to demonstrate the importance of incorporating inertia-dependent fast frequency response in the stochastic scheduling and to indicate the potential for the proposed model to inform reviews of grid codes associated with fast frequency response and future development of inertia-related market.},

The use of wind energy as a promising renewable energy in actual world conjuncture and its use on distributed generation is summarized. A comparison between the main generators used in wind energy production related to the advantages of each one is also shown. For PMSG, the integration generator-grid is accomplished usually by ac–dc–ac electronic conversion. This paper focuses on the ac–dc stage of the connexion. Main rectifier topologies are included, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Considering the rectifiers' behavior, it can be seen that as power goes up, multilevel converters are a tendency. For low-power generators, high-power-factor DCM boost converters are a good choice. According to generator power rate, rectifier topology can be pointed out.},

A structure in which inverter modules are connected in series is proposed to reduce the module maximum voltages and to offer an opportunity to utilize low-voltage wide-band-gap GaN devices. With the superb switching performance of GaN power FETs, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing dc-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD modules are interleaved to suppress the total voltage ripple of dc-link capacitors and to further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configurations and their coupling effect are also investigated as a part of the IMMD design. The proposed structure and design methods are verified by experimental results.},

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has led to significant generation shares of variable RES in power systems worldwide. RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV) units that do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system operation: Since frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, this can lead to large transient frequency and power oscillations in multi-area power systems. Grid topology also has a key role for frequency dynamics as meshed grids are more resilient to disturbances than non-meshed grids. This paper investigates the role of low rotational inertia and different grid topology setups on power system stability for a three-area power system. The presented contributions, both analytical and simulation-based insights, extend previous results for a two-area power system.},

abstract = {This paper investigates an improved active power control method for variable speed wind turbine to enhance the inertial response and damping capability during transient events. The optimized power point tracking (OPPT) controller, which shifts the turbine operating point from the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) curve to the virtual inertia control (VIC) curves according to the frequency deviation, is proposed to release the “hidden” kinetic energy and provide dynamic frequency support to the grid. The effects of the VIC on power oscillation damping capability are theoretically evaluated. Compared to the conventional supplementary derivative regulator-based inertia control, the proposed control scheme can not only provide fast inertial response, but also increase the system damping capability during transient events. Thus, inertial response and power oscillation damping function can be obtained in a single controller by the proposed OPPT control. A prototype three-machine system containing two synchronous generators and a PMSG-based wind turbine with 31{\%} of wind penetration is tested to validate the proposed control strategy on providing rapid inertial response and enhanced system damping.},

abstract = {Mutual inductance is a phenomenon caused by the circulation of the magnetic flux in the core of an electrical machine. It is the result of the effect of the current flowing in one phase on the other phases. In conventional three-phase machines, such an effect has no influence on the electrical behaviour of the device. Although these machines are powered by power inverters, no problem should occur. The result is not the same for multi-star machines. If these machines are using a conventional winding structure, namely distributed windings, and are powered by voltage source converters, current ripples appear in the power supply lines. These current ripples are related to magnetic couplings between the stars. Designers should check these current ripples in order to stay within the limits imposed by the specifications. These electric current disturbances also provide torque ripples. With concentrated windings, a new degree of freedom appears; the configuration—number of slots/number of poles—can have a positive impact. The circulation of the magnetic flux is the initial phenomenon that produces the mutual inductance. The main goal of this discussion is to describe a design method that is able to produce not only a machine with low mutual inductance between phases, but also a multi-star machine where the stars and the phases are magnetically decoupled or less coupled. This discussion only takes into $\backslash$r$\backslash$naccount the machines that use permanent magnets mounted on the rotor surface.

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous technoeconomic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead-acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni-Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

@article{Avenas2015,
abstract = {Power conversion systems are dependent on the performance and reliability of static converters. However, they are subject to frequent functional and environmental strains, which can induce failures. The anticipation of these failures is difficult but important so the operation of a system can be halted before a breakdown occurs. In the case of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, the system can be simplified into two distinct blocks: the solar panels/modules and the power inverter. A breakdown in either of these blocks can cause significant downtime in the system. Nevertheless, multiple solar module failures can often be tolerated and not lead to a total breakdown of the entire array, whereas a single component failure in the inverter can lead to a collapse of the entire system. Furthermore, solar panel/module manufacturers often offer warranties of up to 20 years, while warranties for inverters rarely reach the ten-year mark [1]. As such, the overall cost of a PV inverter can increase by a factor of two or three if it undergoes one or two failures during the life of the system. Although the market competition between PV inverter manufacturers has traditionally focused on the efficiency of their product, a failure that induces a downtime of just a few days can easily negate the yield attained through a 1{\%} efficiency improvement. Oversizing the inverter or introducing redundancy into the inverter system is one option to improve reliability; however, often, this is not economical.},

In an attempt to decrease cost of energy, increase the wind energy conversion efficiency, reliability, power density, and comply with the stringent grid codes, the electric generators and power electronic converters have emerged in a rigorous manner. From the market based survey, the most successful generator-converter configurations are addressed along with few promising topologies available in the literature. The back-to-back connected converters, passive generator-side converters, converters for multiphase generators, and converters without intermediate dc-link are investigated for high-power wind energy conversion systems (WECS), and presented in low and medium voltage category. The onshore and offshore wind farm configurations are analyzed with respect to the series/parallel connection of wind turbine ac/dc output terminals, and high voltage ac/dc transmission. The fault-ride through compliance methods used in the induction and synchronous generator based WECS are also discussed. The past, present and future trends in megawatt WECS are reviewed in terms of mechanical and electrical technologies, integration to power systems, and control theory. The important survey results, and technical merits and demerits of various WECS electrical systems are summarized by tables. The list of current and future wind turbines are also provided along with technical details.},

abstract = {Cascaded multilevel converter structure can be appealing for high-power solar photovoltaic (PV) systems thanks to its modularity, scalability, and distributed maximum power point tracking (MPPT). However, the power mismatch from cascaded individual PV converter modules can bring in voltage and system operation issues. This paper addresses these issues, explores the effects of reactive power compensation and optimization on system reliability and power quality, and proposes coordinated active and reactive power distribution to mitigate this issue. A vector method is first developed to illustrate the principle of power distribution. Accordingly, the relationship between power and voltage is analyzed with a wide operation range. Then, an optimized reactive power compensation algorithm (RPCA) is proposed to improve the system operation stability and reliability, and facilitate MPPT implementation for each converter module simultaneously. Furthermore, a comprehensive control system with the RPCA is designed to achieve effective power distribution and dynamic voltage regulation. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reactive power compensation approach in grid-interactive cascaded PV systems.},

@article{Martinez-Iturralde2015,
abstract = {Interest in permanent magnet synchronous machines for safety-critical applications has been increasing over the years. One of the most common methods for providing fault tolerance to a permanent magnet machine is the active control from the drive side. This method requires designing machines with the lowest possible mutual coupling between phases and a self-inductance that is high enough to limit the fault currents. Fractional-slot concentrated windings have been proposed as the most advantageous solution to meet these requirements. When comparing the numerous combinations of phases, poles and slots that give rise to a fractional-slot concentrated winding, the usual criteria only focus on obtaining a single-layer winding and do not actually consider the relationship between the self-inductance and the mutual inductance between phases. Moreover, they give no recommendations regarding the optimal number of phases from a magnetic point of view. The present work aims to cover this gap by obtaining analytical expressions for the calculation of the inductances in a permanent magnet machine. The derived expressions are investigated regardless of the geometry of the machine, and the criteria for selecting the most promising combinations in terms of the machine's fault tolerance are extracted.},

The proposed hybrid approach improves accu-racy and reduces complexity of the synchronous generator model for winding fault such as turn-to-turn short-circuit (TTSC). This paper also proposes a simple method to model localized saturation effect due to TTSC and presents an air– gap function for synchronous machine with winding fault to improve model accuracy under high degrees of TTSC fault. Experimental validation results show that the developed synchronous generator model with TTSC fault is able to provide improved accuracy and consistent performance under wider degrees of TTSC faults in the stator windings.},

abstract = {Power electronics and renewable energy are two important topics for today's power engineering students. In many cases, the two topics are inextricably intertwined. As the renewable energy sector grows, the need for engineers qualified to design such systems grows as well. In order to train such engineers, new courses are needed that highlight the unique engineering challenges presented by renewable energy systems. This paper presents the theory, implementation, and assessment of a new laboratory course designed to teach power electronics and renewable energy to engineering students. A key element of the course is the use of real renewable energy systems in the laboratory setting. Students design, test, and troubleshoot power electronic circuits (such as dc/dc converters and pulse-width-modulated inverters) with tools used widely in industry (such as MATLAB/Simulink and dSPACE digital signal processors). Ten unique experiments are presented, as well as detailed descriptions of two open-ended design projects: a maximum power point tracker for a photovoltaic array and a full converter for a permanent-magnet wind turbine. Results from students' work on the experiments and final projects, as well as an assessment of the effectiveness of the course based on pre- and post-testing, are also presented. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of RES has led to significant generation shares of variable RES in power systems worldwide. RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and PV that as such do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. The traditional assumption that grid inertia is sufficiently high with only small variations over time is thus not valid for power systems with high RES shares. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system stability and operation. Frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, making frequency control and power system operation more challenging.   This paper investigates the impact of low rotational inertia on power system stability and operation, contributes new analysis insights and offers impact mitigation options.},

Wind power is clean, reliable, and quick to install; it's the leading electricity generation technology in the fight against climate change, enhancing energy security, stabilising electricity prices, cleaning up our air and creating thousands of quality jobs in the manufacturing sector when they're particularly hard to come by. Early 2009, when we published our last set of five year projections, was the absolute low point of the financial crisis. Capital was largely unavailable in most OECD countries, and bankers and consultancies were all predicting a dramatic drop in the renewable energy sector in general and in wind power in particular. GWEC's prediction of 12{\%} growth in the wind sector was generally greeted with disbelief and derision, figuring we were just trying to put a brave face on disaster.},

Instead of utilizing two adjacent active vectors at each switching period as in classic PWM strategies, this new strategy utilizes two nonadjacent active vectors in the case of low-modulation index or three consecutive active vectors in the case of high-modulation index. Analytical calculations show that this new strategy is particularly effective in terms of reducing filtering capacitor rms current for high-power factor compared to space vector PWM which is used as a reference strategy. The impact of this strategy on output current quality is also investigated.},

abstract = {As the development and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems are still growing at an exceptionally rapid pace, relevant grid integration policies are going to change consequently in order to accept more PV systems in the grid. The next generation PV systems will play an even more active role like what the conventional power plants do today in the grid regulation participation. Requirements of ancillary services like Low-Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) associated with reactive current injection and voltage support through reactive power control, have been in effectiveness in some countries. Those advanced features can be provided by next-generation PV systems, and will be enhanced in the future to ensure an even efficient and reliable utilization of PV systems. In the light of this, Reactive Power Injection (RPI) strategies for single-phase PV systems are explored in this paper. The RPI possibilities are: a) constant average active power control, b) constant active current control, c) constant peak current control and d) thermal optimized control strategy. All those strategies comply with the currently active grid codes, but are with different objectives. The thermal optimized control strategy is demonstrated on a 3 kW single-phase PV system by simulations. The other three RPI strategies are verified experimentally on a 1 kW singe-phase system in LVRT operation mode. Those results show the effectiveness and feasibilities of the proposed strategies with reactive power control during LVRT operation. The design and implementation considerations for the characterized strategies are also discussed.},

abstract = {Velocity skin effect (VSE) is a kind of current clustering phenomenon, which occurs at the sliding contact interfaces between the high-speed armature and the stationary rails of electromagnetic railgun launchers. Serious current clustering may lead to local conductor melting, deforming, and discharge erosion, which are disadvantageous to the launching performance, but the physical principle of VSE has not been extracted and summarized so far. The typical current clustering phenomena in static conductors are classified, and the physical principle of VSE is analyzed for rail and armature respectively in this paper. The physical principle in rails is just Skin Effect because of the short risetime of the accepted pulse current, and the physical principle in armature is Clustering Near Small Source (CNSS) and Clustering Along Short Path (CASP) of steady current owing to the continuity characteristic or the voltage drop. An equivalent steady 3-dimension model has been proposed and adopted, and the quantitative distributions of current for U-shaped and cuboid armatures are simulated contrastively by Maxwell 14.0. The simulation results reveal that the current in the interface trends to cluster along the rear perimeter, and the U-shaped armature is superior to the cuboid armature. The physical principle of VSE has importance for restraining VSE.},

Compared to the current state of the art, the salient feature of the proposed designs is elimination and/or reduction of undesirable space harmonics which result from the existing fractional-slot per phase per pole permanent magnet machines with concentric windings. This will bring the benefits of significant reduction of the eddy current loss in the rotor permanent magnets, short end-winding and hence reduced copper loss and copper usage, increased power/torque density, reduction in manufacturing cost, and improved energy efficiency. Although the proposed technique is primarily aimed for brushless permanent magnet machines, it is also applicable to synchronous reluctance machines, induction machines and synchronous wound field machines. The proposed technique is applied to the design of an interior mounted permanent magnet machine for electric vehicle traction applications, and demonstrated by the measurements on a prototype machine.},

Experiments were made in which the linearity, the robustness, the accuracy and the temperature stability of the transformer were tested. The results show that the ratio errors and the phase errors are below 0.07{\%} and 5 min, respectively, when the primary current increased from 25 to 600 A.

As the machine is composed of three three-phase groups, a three-leg converters are connected separately to each group. The topology does not make use of input isolation transformers and reduces the power processed by converter switches when compared to that of conventional two-level converter. Moreover, harmonic distortion in voltages generated by the grid side converter is reduced when compared to conventional two-level converter. The model and the control strategy have been developed. Simulation and experimental results are also presented.},

As a result, a new generation of power devices is being developed for power converter applications in which traditional Si power devices show limited operation. The use of these new power semiconductor devices will allow both an important improvement in the performance of existing power converters and the development of new power converters, accounting for an increase in the efficiency of the electric energy transformations and a more rational use of the electric energy. At present, SiC and GaN are the more promising semiconductor materials for these new power devices as a consequence of their outstanding properties, commercial availability of starting material, and maturity of their technological processes. This paper presents a review of recent progresses in the development of SiC- and GaN-based power semiconductor devices together with an overall view of the state of the art of this new device generation.},

The control synthesis is addressed, based on an assumption that the control can be designed modularly. Additionally, the investigated control system can facilitate fault- tolerant operation without changing the main structure. The robustness of the module control system is analyzed, and the limits for fault-tolerant operation are investigated. The theoretical studies are supported by transient analysis through simulations of the turbine in EMTDC/PSCAD. Finally, the generator/converter solution is verified experimentally. The laboratory results were obtained using a 45 kWprototype with three generator segments and three converter units in series.},

This paper reviews and addresses the research work that has been carried out to reduce the amount of rare-earth material that is used while maintaining the high efficiency and performance that rare-earth PM machines offer. These new machines can use either less rare-earth PM material, weaker ferrite magnets, or no magnets; and they need to meet the high performance that the more usual interior PM synchronous motor with sintered neodymium-iron-boron magnets provides. These machines can take the form of PM-assisted synchronous reluctance machines, induction machines, switched reluctance machines, wound rotor synchronous machines (claw pole or biaxially excited), double-saliency machines with ac or dc stator current control, or brushless dc multiple-phase reluctance machines.},

If properly designed, TES systems can reduce energy costs and consumption, equipment size and pollutant emissions. In order to design efficient control strategies for TES systems, we present a model-based approach with the aim of increasing the performance of HVAC systems with ice cold thermal energy storage (CTES). A simulation environment based on Matlab/Simulink is developed, where thermal behaviour of the plant is analysed by a lumped formulation of the conservation equations. In particular, the ice CTES is modelled as a hybrid system, where the water phase transitions (solid-melting-liquid and liquid-freezing-solid) are described by combining continuous and discrete dynamics, thus considering both latent and sensible heat. Standard control strategies are compared with a non-linear model predictive control (NLMPC) approach. In the simulation examples model predictive control proves to be the best control solution for the efficient management of ice CTES systems. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, a new control approach for the 200 kW solar photovoltaic grid connected system with perturb and observe maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is implemented. Power quality improvement with comparison is conducted during fault with proportional integral (PI) and artificial intelligence-based fuzzy logic controlled DVR. MPPT tracks the actual variable DC link voltage while deriving the maximum power from a photovoltaic array and maintains DC link voltage constant by changing modulation index of the converter. Simulation results during fault show that the fuzzy logic based DVR scheme demonstrates simultaneous exchange of active and reactive power with less total harmonic distortion (THD) present in voltage source converter (VSC) current and grid current with fast tracking of optimum operating point at unity power factor. Standards (IEEE-519/1547), stipulates that the current with THD greater than 5{\%} cannot be injected into the grid by any distributed generation source. Simulation results and validations of MPPT technique and operation of fuzzy logic controlled DVR demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

abstract = {As the development and installation of photovoltaic (PV) systems are still growing at an exceptionally rapid pace, relevant grid integration policies are going to change consequently in order to accept more PV systems in the grid. The next generation PV systems will play an even more active role like what the conventional power plants do today in the grid regulation participation. Requirements of ancillary services like Low-Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) associated with reactive current injection and voltage support through reactive power control, have been in effectiveness in some countries. Those advanced features can be provided by next-generation PV systems, and will be enhanced in the future to ensure an even efficient and reliable utilization of PV systems. In the light of this, Reactive Power Injection (RPI) strategies for single-phase PV systems are explored in this paper. The RPI possibilities are: a) constant average active power control, b) constant active current control, c) constant peak current control and d) thermal optimized control strategy. All those strategies comply with the currently active grid codes, but are with different objectives. The thermal optimized control strategy is demonstrated on a 3 kW single-phase PV system by simulations. The other three RPI strategies are verified experimentally on a 1 kW singe-phase system in LVRT operation mode. Those results show the effectiveness and feasibilities of the proposed strategies with reactive power control during LVRT operation. The design and implementation considerations for the characterized strategies are also discussed.},

These reserves are continuously regulated in order to match the generation and consumption in the system and thus, to maintain a constant electrical frequency. They are usually provided by synchronized conventional generating units such as hydraulic or thermal power plants. With the progressive displacement of these generating plants by non-synchronized renewable-based power plants (e.g. wind and solar) the net level of synchronous power reserves in the system becomes reduced. Therefore, wind power plants are required, according to some European Grid Codes, to also provide power reserves like conventional generating units do.

abstract = {This paper presents an accurate analytical model to calculate the power loss of a high voltage Gallium Nitride high electron mobility transistor (GaN HEMT) in cascode configuration. The proposed model considers the package and PCB parasitic inductances, the nonlinearity of the junction capacitors, and the transconductance of the cascode GaN transistor. The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results. The results of both the analytical model and experiments suggest that soft-switching is critical for high voltage GaN in high-frequency high-efficiency applications.},

abstract = {This paper gives a comprehensive review of the state of the art of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) and technologies, with an emphasis on wind power generator and control. First, different types of common WECSs are classified according to their features and drive train types. The WECSs are compared on the basis of the volume, weight, cost, efficiency, system reliability and fault ride through capability. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control, which aims to make the generator speed meet an optimum value to ensure the maximum energy yield, plays a key role in the variable speed WECSs. A comprehensive review and comparison of the four most popular MPPT control methods are carried out and improvements for each method are presented. Furthermore, the latest development of wind energy conversion technologies is introduced, such as the brushless doubly fed induction generator (BDFIG), the stator permanent magnet synchronous generators, the magnetic-geared generators, dual power flow WECS with the electrical variable transmission (EVT) machine, and direct grid-connected WECS. Finally, the future trends of the technologies are discussed.},

As a result, a new generation of power devices is being developed for power converter applications in which traditional Si power devices show limited operation. The use of these new power semiconductor devices will allow both an important improvement in the performance of existing power converters and the development of new power converters, accounting for an increase in the efficiency of the electric energy transformations and a more rational use of the electric energy. At present, SiC and GaN are the more promising semiconductor materials for these new power devices as a consequence of their outstanding properties, commercial availability of starting material, and maturity of their technological processes. This paper presents a review of recent progresses in the development of SiC- and GaN-based power semiconductor devices together with an overall view of the state of the art of this new device generation.},

The advantage of such an approach is that new degrees of freedom (irregular slot distribution, non-uniform distribution of the number of turns) likely to improve the distribution of the MMF waveform are taken into account. The example of application is given for two specific three phase windings; the first is characterized by a working harmonic of order five and the second by a working harmonic of order seven.},

The physical principle of VSE is Skin Effect of pulsed current in rails, and Clustering Near Small Source and Clustering Along Short Path of steady current in armature. The corresponding methods to restrain VSE was deduced and classified in this paper as the followings: 1) to lengthen the contact surface according to the velocity skin depth expression, 2) to add a hard and resistive cladding on the rail's sliding surface and 3) to narrow the interface considering the Clustering Near Small Source, 4) to adopt U-shaped armature instead of cuboid armature and 5) to control the armature legs' thickness distribution owing to Clustering Along Short Path. The equivalent 3-D models for VSE were adopted and the contrastive simulations were carried out for three kinds of armature's legs. The most uniformed distribution of current in three interfaces was accomplished, with which the typical uniform index is about 66{\%}. The conclusion reached was that the general use of five methods and reasonable design could effectively restrain velocity skin effect.},

In many MPC problems, a long prediction horizon is required to ensure an adequate closed-loop performance in steady state and to avoid stability issues. However, the computational effort of solving the optimization problem underlying MPC problems with long prediction horizons is often very great, making the implementation of such schemes in real time a difficult and challenging task. To overcome this difficulty, three established methodologies are surveyed that yield long prediction horizons with a modest computational burden. Case studies are investigated to substantiate the merits of these schemes. More specifically, for dc?dc boost converters, a move blocking strategy is reviewed, and for ac medium-voltage (MV) drives, both an extrapolation and an event-based horizon strategy are examined.},

Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration.

Solar and wind energy forecasting are based on phenomenological models with updated data. A neural network for two-day-ahead electric consumption forecasting is also designed. The system is tested using real data sets from an existent microgrid in Chile (ESUSCON). The results based on different operation conditions show the economic sense of the proposal. A full practical implementation of the system for ESUSCON is envisioned.},

abstract = {This paper presents an axial-flux permanent magnet motor optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA)-based sizing equation and the finite-element analysis (FEA). The designed slotted TORUS motor produces sinusoidal back-EMF waveform, maximum power density, and reduced cogging torque. The GA obtained the dimensions of motors with different numbers of slots and the highest possible power density. Electromagnetic field analysis of the candidate motors obtained from GA with various dimensions is subjected through FEA to obtain the motors' characteristics. Based on the GA and FEA results, a candidate motor design is introduced and subjected to FEA for reoptimization and finalization of the motor design. Techniques like modifying winding configuration and permanent magnet skewing are investigated to attain the most sinusoidal back-EMF waveform and reduced cogging torque. FEA and GA simulation results are compared and agreed well to the flux density in various areas of the designed motor at no-load condition. The final designed motor (1 kW, 50 Hz, four poles) is fabricated and tested. Experimental results agree with those of the simulation, both satisfying the desired technical specifications.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with thermal management aspects of electric machinery used in high-performance applications with particular focus put on electric machines designed for hybrid electric vehicle applications. In the first part of this thesis, new thermal models of liquid (water and oil) cooled electric machines are proposed. The proposed thermal models are based on a combination of lumped parameter (LP) and numerical methods. As a first case study, a permanent-magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PMaSRM) equipped with a housing water jacket is considered. Particular focus is put on the stator winding and a thermal model is proposed that divides the stator slot into a number of elliptical copper and impregna- tion layers. Additionally, an analysis, using results from a proposed simplified thermal finite element (FE) model representing only a single slot of the sta- tor and its corresponding end winding, is presented in which the number of layers and the proper connection between the parts of the LP thermal model representing the end winding and the active part of winding are determined. The approach is attractive due to its simplicity and the fact that it closely models the actual temperature distribution for common slot geometries. An oil-cooled induction machine where the oil is in direct contact with the stator laminations is also considered. Here, a multi-segment structure is proposed that divides the stator, winding and cooling system into a number of an- gular segments. Thereby, the circumferential temperature variation due to the nonuniform distribution of the coolant in the cooling channels can be predicted. In the second part of this thesis, the thermal impact of using different winding impregnation and steel lamination materials is studied. Conven- tional varnish, epoxy and a silicone based thermally conductive impregnation material are investigated and the resulting temperature distributions in three small induction machines are compared. The thermal impact of using different steel lamination materials is investigated by simulations using the developed thermal model of the water cooled PMaSRM. The differences in alloy con- tents and steel lamination thickness are studied separately and a comparison between the produced iron losses and the resulting hot-spot temperatures is presented. Finally, FE-based approaches for estimating the induced magnet eddycurrent losses in the rotor of the considered PMaSRM are reviewed and compared in the form of a case study based on simulations. A simplified three-dimensional FE model and an analytical model, both combined with time-domain 2D FE analysis, are shown to predict the induced eddy current losses with a relatively good accuracy compared to a complete 3D FE based model. Hence, the two simplified approaches are promising which motivates a possible future experimental verification.},

Tests were performed over 8. h periods for three different plumbing configurations and two different hourly draw volumes. Simulations were conducted using the TRNSYS simulation environment, and the results showed that the TRNSYS model was in good agreement with the experimental results, where the discrepancies between data were found mainly in the regions of high temperature gradients within the storage tanks.

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents a high power, three-phase, single-stage, grid connected PV system with MPPT and reactive power injection capability into the utility grid. For current control, Park's d-q transformation technique is used by using filtered three-phase grid voltage. A modified voltage controller using feedback linearization scheme with feed forward PV current signal is proposed to regulate the DC-link voltage. Reactive power feeding into the grid is also realized. To perform several simulations, PSCAD/EMTDC software environment is used. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The direct torque control approach called model predictive direct torque control (MP-DTC) is extended to field-weakening operation in this research. The controller is of the finite control set (FCS) type, which takes the discrete states of the voltage source inverter (VSI) into account. Each sampling period, the future behavior of the plant is predicted and inputs (voltage vectors) are selected using an optimization criterion, i.e., a cost function. Optimization, however, depend on the operation region. Maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) tracking for high electrical efficiency is aimed below rated speed, operation off the MTPA trajectory is necessary for obtaining field-weakening. In this work, a cost function is designed, which is suitable for operation at high speeds without penalizing operation below rated speed. MP-DTC is applied to permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive systems. High control performances, i.e., dynamics, is obtained without increasing the switching frequency nor reducing significantly the torque quality. This feature is interesting above all for high power applications. The proposed control strategy has been evaluated on a small-scale (PMSM) drive system with two-level VSI for demonstration showing promising results.},

In some cases, they can provide superior response to generators, as the curtailment of load is typically much faster than ramping thermal and hydropower plants. Analysis and quantification of demand response resources providing ancillary services is necessary to understand the resources' economic value and impact on the power system. Methodologies used to study grid integration of variable generation can be adapted to the study of demand response. In the present work, we describe and implement a methodology to construct detailed temporal and spatial representations of demand response resources and to incorporate those resources into power system models. In addition, the paper outlines ways to evaluate barriers to implementation. We demonstrate how the combination of these three analyses can be used to assess economic value of the realizable potential of demand response for ancillary services.},

Then, possible future generator systems are reviewed. Hydraulic transmissions are significantly lighter than gearboxes and enable continuously variable transmission, but their efficiency is lower. A brushless DFIG is a medium speed generator without brushes and with improved low-voltage ride-through characteristics compared with the DFIG. Magnetic pseudo DDs are smaller and lighter than DD generators, but need a sufficiently low and stable magnet price to be successful. In addition, superconducting generators can be smaller and lighter than normal DD generators, but both cost and reliability need experimental demonstration.

abstract = {Smart grids are often analyzed using a top-down approach, i.e., starting from communication and control technologies evolution, to then focus on their effects on active and passive users, in terms of new services, higher efficiency and quality of supply. However, with their bottom-up approach, virtual power plants (VPP) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration of distributed generation (DG) and energy storage devices as well as valid means for enabling consumers to respond to load management signals, when operated under the supervision of a scheduling coordinator. These aggregation factors can be very profitable for the distributed energy resources (DERs) economy and for the energy network itself. This paper presents a new algorithm to optimize the day-ahead thermal and electrical scheduling of a large scale VPP (LSVPP) which contains: a) many small-scale producers and consumers (“prosumers”) distributed over a large territory and b) energy storage and cogeneration processes. The algorithm also takes into account the actual location of each DER in the public network and their specific capability. Thermal and electrical generator models, load and storage devices are very detailed and flexible, as are the rates and incentives framework. Several novelties, with respect to the previous literature, are proposed. Case study results are also described and discussed},

However, It is expected, the full potential for storage for distribution upgrade deferral cannot be fully realized due to high cost of EES. On the other hand, EES used for distribution deferral application can support a variety of complementary storage applications such as energy price arbitrage, time of use (TOU) energy cost reduction, wholesale electricity market ancillary services, and transmission upgrade deferral. Aggregation of benefits of these complementary storage applications would have the potential for increasing the amount of EES that may be financially attractive to defer distribution network augmentation in QLD. In this context, this paper analyzes distribution upgrade deferral, energy price arbitrage, TOU energy cost reduction, and integrated solar PV-storage benefits of EES devices in QLD.  2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Wind power is still the most promising renewable energy in the year of 2013. The wind turbine system (WTS) started with a few tens of kilowatt power in the 1980s. Now, multimegawatt wind turbines are widely installed even up to 6–8 MW. There is a widespread use of wind turbines in the distribution networks and more and more wind power stations, acting as power plants, are connected directly to the transmission networks. As the grid penetration and power level of the wind turbines increase steadily, the wind power starts to have significant impacts to the power grid system. Therefore, more advanced generators, power electronic systems, and control solutions have to be introduced to improve the characteristics of the wind power plant and make it more suitable to be integrated into the power grid. Meanwhile, there are also some emerging technology challenges, which need to be further clarified and investigated. This paper gives an overview and discusses some development trends in the technologies used for wind power systems. First, the developments of technology and market are generally discussed. Next, several state-of-the-art wind turbine concepts, as well as the corresponding power electronic converters and control structures, are reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, grid requirements and the technology challenges for the future WTS are also addressed.},

Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design.

abstract = {The future power systems face several challenges; one of them is the use of high power converters that virtually decouple primary energy source from the AC power grid. An important consequence of this situation is their effect on total system inertia and the ability to overcome the system's frequency disturbances. The wind power industry has created a controller to enable inertial response on wind turbines generators: Synthetic Inertial. This paper evaluates the effects of the inertia emulation of wind turbines based on full-converters and their effect on total system inertia after frequency disturbances happen. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate (based on simulations) that during an under-frequency transients on future power systems, synthetic inertia does not completely avoid worse scenarios in terms of under-frequency load shedding. The extra power delivered from a wind turbine during frequency disturbances can increase “momentary” the total system inertia and substantially reduce the rate of change of frequency providing time for the active governors to respond. However, synthetic inertia might not completely avoid under-frequency load shedding.},

@article{Hernandez2013a,
abstract = {SUMMARY This paper explores how adding power flow devices incrementally to constrained transmission lines provides benefits to both wind generation developers and transmission owners. Capital is only spent when it is necessary, generation developers can be charged incrementally, in-service dates can be accelerated and congestion can be relieved providing economic benefits to the region. Introduction Utility scale wind deployments in the US have increased rapidly over the last decade and according to interconnection request data in various regions, additional deployments are expected. Renewable energy expansion subjects stakeholders, such as transmission owners (TOs) and generation developers, to uncertainty including schedule uncertainty, location uncertainty, financial uncertainty and operational uncertainty. These uncertainties are in addition to the greater uncertainty that TOs are facing compared to the era of vertically integrated utilities with coordinated transmission and generation planning. All of these factors impact the scope, timeline and cost of transmission expansion required to successfully interconnect and operate new wind generation customers. This paper reviews the challenges of wind interconnection from the TO's perspective and discusses the possibility of employing scalable power flow control solutions on the existing transmission system in order to minimize this uncertainty in all four dimensions while also reducing or eliminating transmission congestion on existing transmission lines. Scalable power flow control allows transmission utilities to interconnect new generation customers in a flexible manner, bring generation online sooner and allocate costs to customers incrementally. Further, it can provide a cost effective way to minimize congestion that can result in curtailing wind generators during critical load periods. Consequences of Transmission Constraints Utility-scale wind deployments in the US have increased rapidly over the last decade. Financial incentives, state and federal regulations, and climate change concerns continue to drive the construction of more renewable capacity, and the EPA's proposed clean power plan is adding an additional layer of uncertainty. Constraints on the transmission grid tend to be one of the main challenges to integrating utility scale wind generators. These constraints cause two main issues:  Certain constraints must be resolved before a wind generator can be brought online initially, increasing the fixed cost of wind deployment.  Constraints may cause congestion at certain times resulting in wind generators being curtailed (turned off) even when the wind is blowing, reducing generator revenue.  The cost and time to address some transmission constraints may derail certain generation projects altogether.},

abstract = {Globally, buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of the total world annual energy consumption which is responsible for one-third of green house gas emissions around the world. A significant portion of this energy is used for lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning purposes in buildings. Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of green house gas emissions and CFCs triggered a renewed interest in environmentally friendly cooling, and heating technologies for buildings. Free cooling of buildings may be seen as an alternate to compressor based air conditioning systems used for the buildings. In free cooling, nighttime cold is accumulated in storage material and extracted when needed. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) can be used for free-cooling purposes due to their high storage density. In free cooling, using PCM as storage material, cool air during night is used to solidify the PCM and the accumulated cold is extracted during the hot day times. In this article a detailed review of work conducted by different researchers on PCM based free cooling is presented. Major challenges being faced in the design of PCM based free cooling system such as phase change materials; their thermo-physical properties and the geometry of encapsulation are elaborated and discussed in detail. Also the parameters effecting the charging and discharging of PCM, effect of phase change temperature and climatic conditions on thermal performance of the free cooling system are also discussed. Potential reduction in CO2 emissions due to the applicability of free cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings is also discussed in this article. This paper also provides a comprehensive list of the PCMs currently being used and that can be used potentially for free cooling applications. At last, this paper also presents some current problems needed further research in this area. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The dc bus capacitor presents a significant barrier to meeting inverter cost, volume, and weight requirements for mass production of affordable EVs/HEVs. The large ripple currents become even more problematic for the film capacitors (the capacitor technology of choice for EVs/HEVs) in high temperature environments as their ripple current handling capability decreases rapidly with rising temperatures. It is shown in previous work that segmenting the VSI based traction drive system can significantly decrease the ripple currents and thus the size of the dc bus capacitor.

abstract = {Wind energy conversion systems (WECS) nowadays offer an extremely wide range of topologies, including various different types of electrical generators and power converters. Wind energy is also an application of great interest to students and with a huge potential for engineering employment. Making WECS the main center of interest when teaching power electronics and electrical machines can therefore be highly advantageous. This paper describes a novel teaching experience using wind energy as the starting point for understanding power electronics and electrical machines. The results point out the wide variety of concepts involved in the course, the numerous competences that it can enhance, and its positive reception by learners.},

abstract = {The use of wind energy is now an established fact, and many educational institutions are introducing this topic into their engineering studies. Problem-based learning (PBL), as a student-centered instructional approach, has contributed to important developments in engineering education over the last few years. This paper presents the experience of a problem-based learning approach within the context of teaching wind energy conversion systems for electricity generation at an Electrical and Electronic Master's degree level. Students were given the problem of finding the response of a wind turbine to a grid fault. Groups of three students worked on a cooperative learning project for 15 weeks, with the instructor providing resource assistance and information at all stages of the work. Two tools were designed to help the students: a virtual wind turbine simulator and a real wind turbine setup. Both experimental tools are described, and the results obtained by the students are discussed. The results show that the students valued both tools and were able to address problems at a high cognitive level.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of motor drive technologies used for safety-critical aerospace applications, with a particular focus placed on the choice of candidate machines and their drive topologies. Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for optimal sizing of an energy storage system (ESS) in a microgrid (MG) for storing electrical/renewable energy at the time of surplus and for re-dispatching. The unit commitment problem with spinning reserve for MG is considered in this new method. The total cost function, which includes the cost of ESS, cost of output power and cost of spinning reserve, is introduced. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG. The main method is formulated as a mixed nonlinear integer problem (MNIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming).},

abstract = {Optical current transformers/transducers (OCTs) produce digital and analog signals. In recent years, they have become more available, playing an increasingly important role in electric power grid upgrades. This requires developing accurate models for relay testing and relay performance evaluations to ensure that the system equipment is safe. This study presents several models developed for OCT: analog, digital, and complete models. It applies previously studied and presented frequency-response characteristics to develop a transfer function using a complex curve-fitting method. An analog circuit model is constructed from the developed transfer function via a network synthesis method. A digital model is presented by transforming the developed transfer function into a digital domain transfer function using bilinear transformation. The digital model implementation is performed by the direct form I block diagram. The optics model and electronics model of the device are developed separately and are then combined to present a complete model. The Jones calculus method is used for optical modeling, and a developed transfer function is used for electronics modeling. All of the developed models are verified through the frequency-response results and tested with PSpice and Matlab Simulink programs. The results show that the developed models can be used as legitimate OCT models.},

abstract = {This paper presents a digital optimal battery charger that has an inherent characteristics of detecting the fault (main switch failure, i.e., TOP FET failure of the converter) within one switching cycle. The charger consists of synchronous buck converter and a novel carrier generation (synthetic ripple) based digital feedback clamped hysteretic modulator. The proposed charger charges the battery with the constant current for less battery state of charge (SOC) and charges it with the constant voltage when the battery SOC reaches near 100{\%}. The charger facilitates smooth and stable transition from constant current (CC) mode to constant voltage (CV) mode without the need of extra switch or control loop. The novel feedback clamped digital hysteretic modulator used in the charger generates carrier to the hysteretic comparator in the field programmable gate array (FPGA) based digital domain by generating piece-wise linear synthetic ripple using sensed converter voltages (switch node voltage and the output voltage), without the need of direct inductor current sensing and adding the output voltage to it. The regulation loop is clamped and hence the charger remains in the feedback controlled during the whole charging cycle. Experimental and simulation results verify the operation of the proposed charging system on 20 W prototype. The performance of the charger is verified on a 6 V-4.5 Ah lead acid battery as well.},

@article{Geyer2012,
abstract = {Industrial applications of medium-voltage drives impose increasingly stringent performance requirements, particularly with regard to harmonic distortions of the phase currents of the controlled electrical machine. An established method to achieve very low current distortions during steady-state operation is to employ offline calculated optimized pulse patterns (OPP). Achieving high dynamic performance, however, proves to be very difficult in a system operated by OPPs. In this paper, we propose a method that combines the optimal steady-state performance of OPPs with the very fast dynamics of trajectory tracking control. A constrained optimal control problem with a receding horizon policy, i.e., model predictive control (MPC), is formulated and solved. Results show that the combination of MPC with OPPs satisfies both the strict steady-state as well as the dynamic performance requirements imposed by the most demanding industrial applications. The estimation of the fundamental components of the machine variables separately from their respective harmonic components is not required. As a result, complicated structures such as observers can be avoided, contrary to state-of-the-art methods. A further advantage of the MPC method is the use of a receding horizon policy, which provides feedback and a high degree of robustness.},

abstract = {Gallium–nitride power transistor (GaN HEMT) and integrated circuit technologies have matured dramatically over the last few years, and many hundreds of thousands of devices have been manufactured and fielded in applications ranging from pulsed radars and counter-IED jammers to CATV modules and fourth-generation infrastructure base-stations. GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management—examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs. This paper describes examples of broadband amplifiers, as well as several of the main areas of high-efficiency amplifier design—notably Class-D, Class-E, Class-F, and Class-J approaches, Doherty PAs, envelope-tracking techniques, and Chireix outphasing.},

A test grid is used to also investigate the variation of system inertia as a function of time. It is shown that by integrating renewables in the generation mix, the frequency support deteriorates, but through additional control, the frequency support can be improved. Finally the control of an inertialess grid is shortly described and some recommendations for future research are given.},

abstract = {In order to improve the efficiency of wind power generation system (WPGS), many researchers have tried to develop a larger WPGS and a superconducting synchronous generator (SCSG) has been suggested to develop over 5 MW class WPGS. There are two expected types of drive-train, geared and gearless. The structure and electrical parameters of the SCSG depend on the type of drive-train used. This paper deals with a comparative analysis of the 10 MW class geared and gearless types of the SCSG for WPGS. Three drive-trains are designed for the 10 MW class SCSGs using the finite elements method analysis tool. The PSCAD/EMTDC is utilized to simulate electrical and dynamic behaviors of the modeled SCSGs. The simulation results show the operation characteristics of the designed SCSGs and suggest that the single-stage gearbox type drive-train is the most efficient drive-train for the SCSG due to the reduction of the number of rotor poles and the volume of the generator, even though the geared-type drive-train requires periodical maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2002-2011 IEEE.},

The heat exchange between the heat transfer fluid and the PCM and its phase change are investigated. Under simplifying assumptions, it is shown that the governing equations are the three energy conservation equations written for the heat transfer fluid, the wall and the PCM. The PCM energy conservation equation is written in terms of enthalpy. All three parabolic differential equations are numerically solved according to a finite difference approach implemented in MATLAB language. The simulations are conducted in order to derive the temperature profiles inside the PCM and to estimate the time needed to complete the melting of the PCM. Different simulation campaigns are conducted varying the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid. The obtained results can be used as guidelines for more careful studies of the thermal storage system and for subsequent analysis and optimization processes.},

abstract = {As the penetration of variable renewable generation increases in power systems worldwide, planning for the effects of variability will become more important. Traditional capacity adequacy planning techniques have been supplemented with integration studies, which have been carried out in power systems with high targets for renewable generation. These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system generation planning techniques evolve with the challenge of integrating variable generation, the flexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability needs to be assessed. The insufficient ramping resource expectation (IRRE) metric is proposed to measure power system flexibility for use in long-term planning, and is derived from traditional generation adequacy metrics. Compared to existing generation adequacy metrics, flexibility assessment is more data intensive. A flexibility metric can identify the time intervals over which a system is most likely to face a shortage of flexible resources, and can measure the relative impact of changing operational policies and the addition of flexible resources. The flexibility of a test system with increasing penetrations of variable generation is assessed. The results highlight the time horizons of increased and decreased risk associated with the integration of VG.},

@article{Delille2012,
abstract = {In electrical islands, frequency excursions are sizeable and automatic load shedding is often required in response to disturbances. Moreover, the displacement of conventional generation with wind and solar plants, which usually do not provide inertial response, further weakens these power systems. Fast-acting storage, by injecting power within instants after the loss of a generating unit, can back up conventional generation assets during the activation of their primary reserve. This paper relies on dynamic simulations to study the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by energy storage systems in the French island of Guadeloupe with large shares of wind or solar generation. The results show that fast-acting storage, by acting as a synthetic inertia, can mitigate the impact of these sources on the dynamic performance of the studied island grid in the case of a major generation outage. The other concerns raised by renewables (e.g., variability, forecast accuracy, low voltage ride-through, etc.) have not been addressed within this project.},

The total cost function, which includes the cost of ESS, cost of output power and cost of spinning reserve, is introduced. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by a case study where the optimal ESS rating for MG is determined. The quantitative results show that the ESS with an optimal size is not only storing renewable energy and re-dispatching it appropriately, but also saving the the total cost for MG. The main method is formulated as a mixed nonlinear integer problem (MNIP), which is solved in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming).},

abstract = {A concept of an integrated and distributed inverter for switched reluctance machines is introduced. The application at hand is an outer-rotor direct drive designed for railway traction applications. A five-phase switched reluctance machine was developed and is used to demonstrate the function of the integrated and distributed inverter. The distribution is achieved by supplying each phase coil with its own modular inverter. Each inverter module is placed evenly around the end of the stator stack next to its dedicated coil. This increases the redundancy of the drive significantly. The likelihood of phase-to-phase faults is reduced, because no overlapping end-turns are necessary. Also, the integration of machine and inverter is simplified, because the semiconductors can be evenly distributed around the machine. The concept reduces the amount of terminals between drive and vehicle to communication, power supply, and cooling, independent of the number of machine phases. With the integrated and distributed inverter new control strategies can be developed to influence machine vibration and radiated noise. In this paper, the design of the prototype, the direct torque control of the five-phase machine, and the behavior in the case of a fault inside a module is analyzed.},

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) cell characteristics are highly nonlinear that gives single Maximum Power Point (MPP) on P-V curve under uniform insolation condition. The characteristics and hence MPP point changes with the variation in insolation and temperature. In order to extract a maximum power from PV array, a fuzzy based MPP tracking algorithm is proposed. The algorithm accepts single input that is slope of P-V curve and generates the duty ratio as an output that operates the boost converter to track MPP. The algorithm gives faster convergence by applying variable step in duty ratio and gives accurate MPP. The two stage grid interactive PV system described in this paper supplies active power as well as provides harmonic and reactive power compensation. This additional feature increases the effective utilization of PV inverter and increases the overall efficiency of the system. The simulation results validate the performance and stability of the grid interactive PV system using the proposed algorithm for active current injection as well as harmonics and reactive power compensation. � 2012 IEEE.},

The credibility of the models created with SPEED and MotorCAD has been confirmed by comparing the results of simulation and measurement performed on a 12 kW synchronous permanent magnet motor available in the laboratory. The goal of the optimization has been to minimize the weight of the motor under condition that the motor delivers rated power of 15 kW at rated speed of 3000 rpm with hot-spot temperature not exceeding the temperature limits of class F insulation (155 ◦ C). Two optimal BLDC motor designs with slot/pole combinations 12/10 and 18/16 have been obtained. The motor with 18 slots and 16 poles yields the highest torque density with the lowest mass of active parts (copper+laminations+magnets) of only 5.1 kg.},

abstract = {PV inverters are an important element of the future smart grids. Not only they contribute to the active power generation as distributed generators (DGs), but also they can help grid voltage/frequency stability by generating VAR. Although the number of PV installations is rapidly growing, the effective utilization of PV inverters remains low. As even if inverters are to operate in VAR mode during night hours, they still need some active power to compensate for their internal losses, regulate the DC bus and provide the desired level of reactive power. This paper will provide a detailed analysis of PV inverters' operation in VAR compensation mode when active power is not available. A new control scheme is proposed that enables inverter to absorb little active power from grid, regulate its DC bus voltage within limits, and inject the desired level of reactive power. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the analysis.},

abstract = {The present paper suggests a procedure for identification of suitable models for the heat dynamics of a building. Such a procedure for model identification is essential for better usage of readings from smart meters, which is expected to be installed in almost all buildings in the coming years. The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results. A case study is described in which a suitable model is sought after for a single storey 120 m
                        2 building. The result is a set of different models of increasing complexity, with which building characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, heat capacity of different parts, and window area, are estimated. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper addresses research questions associated with the method by which the energy per cost is calculated. It aims at presenting more accurate calculations based on a combination of methods that take into account lifetime operation of wind turbines. Such calculations are not available for megawatt (MW) level turbines. The proposed method is used to evaluate typical permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) available in the technical literature. The new method's outcome is compared to conventional methods used to calculate energy yield per cost. It is shown that lifetime cost calculations come in favour of gearless PMSGs, which have higher material and construction costs.},

The C-GEN is prior to conventional PM generators by absence of magnetic attraction forces between rotor and stator, absence of cogging torque, ease of manufacturing, modularity and high fault-toleration [1]. Firstly, the integrated analytical design tool that couples electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the generator has been introduced. Then, an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm has been used to maximize the annual electricity generation and to minimize the initial cost of the generator. The optimized generator is validated using FEA tools and the specifications of the generator has been presented.},

This efficiency well exceeds the value by IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor). This demonstrates that GaN has a great potential for power switching application competing with SiC. Fully reduced on-state resistance in a new normally-off GaN transistor called Gate Injection Transistor (GIT) greatly helps to increase the efficiency. In addition, use of the bidirectional operation of the lateral and compact GITs with synchronous gate driving, the inverter is operated free from fly-wheel diodes which have been connected in parallel with IGBTs in a conventional inverter system.},

Then, the analytical solutions for back emf, electromagnetic torque, and efficiency of the PM-type axial flux machines are derived by using the magnetic field solutions and considering simple equivalent circuits. The analytical results are validated extensively by 3-D FE results. Test results such as back-emf, torque, and efficiency measurements are also presented to show the effectiveness of the analyses.},

abstract = {—Power electronics is an enabling technology found in most renewable energy generation systems. Because of its superior voltage blocking capabilities and fast switching speeds, silicon carbide (SiC) power electronics are considered for use in power conversion units in wind generation systems in this paper. The potential efficiency gains from the use of SiC devices in a wind gen-eration system are explored by simulations, with the system mod-eling explained in detail. The performance of the SiC converter is analyzed and compared to its silicon counterpart at different wind speeds, temperatures, and switching frequencies. The quantitative results are based on SiC metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) prototypes from Cree and modern Si in-sulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) products. A conclusion is drawn that the SiC converters can improve the wind system power conversion efficiency and can reduce the system's size and cost due to the low-loss, high-frequency, and high-temperature properties of SiC devices, even for one-for-one replacement for Si devices.

abstract = {Pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) ac drives generate high differential-mode (DM) motor voltages due to the reflected wave phenomenon. The common-mode (CM) voltage produced by a PWM inverter also has fast transitions that result in high peak currents to ground. For low-power ac drives, this can present several issues, such as pump-up of the dc bus and failure of the power module due to high instantaneous currents that are often undetected because of the typical sampling algorithm used. In this paper, existing drive output filter solutions are reviewed, and a new filter design is presented, which has integrated DM and CM impedance with damping matched to typical cable surge impedance. This eliminates reflections of both DM and CM traveling waves and also reduces peak cable charging currents. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the new filter has improved performance to reduce motor DM and CM voltages and drive output CM current, thus mitigating the issues specifically seen with low-power ac drives. Complete design details for the filter and a particular implementation of the integrated DM and CM reactor are also presented.},

With the appropriate power converter, DER can provide ancillary services such as frequency control and voltage support. This paper outlines the economic potential of DERs coordinated in a microgrid to provide reactive power and voltage support at its point of common coupling. The DER Customer Adoption Model assesses the costs of providing reactive power, given local utility rules. Depending on the installed DER, the cost minimizing solution for supplying reactive power locally is chosen. Costs include the variable cost of the additional losses and the investment cost of appropriately over-sizing converters or purchasing capacitors. A case study of a large health care building in San Francisco is used to evaluate different revenue possibilities of creating an incentive for microgrids to provide reactive power.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of wind turbine generator systems and describes some trends. Around 1998, many wind turbine manufacturers changed from constant speed systems to variable speed with doubly-fed induction generators. Since around 2005, they have come with a number of alternative generators systems, mainly to comply with grid requirements as grid-fault ride-through. Most alternatives have brushless generators and full converters. One of them is the direct-drive system. If the availability of permanent magnet materials can be guaranteed, permanent-magnet generators are considered as the most suitable direct-drive generators. The increasing importance of offshore wind energy results in an increasing attention for reliability and availability.},

abstract = {The rapidly developing wind power industry demands high power generators. Direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), which has the advantages of high drive train efficiency and high reliability, is promising in wind turbine applications, especially offshore. It is known, that direct driven PMSG is heavier than its geared counterparts, which increases the cost and may bring up engineering challenges. Integrating the active parts of PMSG with the blades, hub or nacelle and sharing the carrying structures can give considerable reduction of the top head mass. Integrated design challenges the electromagnetic and thermal analysis of PMSG from the perspective of whole system and the design approach may differ from the conventional. This paper presents an overview of the modeling methods for the design of PMSG. First, the drive train technology is discussed and challenges in the design of PMSG are identified. Secondly, the electromagnetic and thermal design methods are reviewed. Finally, development of simulation software is investigated.},

abstract = {Several manufacturers offer optical current transformers (OCTs) to replace the conventional magnetic current transformers (CTs). This paper compares the performances of some commercially available optical and conventional CTs. The steady state and transient responses of the two systems are compared in a laboratory. Field records are also obtained and evaluated to verify that the optical systems can replace conventional instrument transformers. In addition, OCT step response as well as the impact of ambient temperature on the OCT performance has been investigated. Results show that optical CTs are more than suitable for replacing conventional CTs. Further, the results also show that OCT has better frequency response than conventional CT. Differences found in the field and laboratory measurements are within experimental errors. Unlike the conventional CT, the OCT can have a digital output according to the IEC 61850 standard. The digital output of the OCT is tested for its frequency-amplitude characteristic. Results confirm that digital output has a narrower bandwidth than the low energy analog output of the OCT due to the limited sampling rate prescribed in a UCA guide to IEC-61850-9-2.},

abstract = {Integrating a battery energy storage system (BESS) with a large wind farm can make a wind farm more dispatchable. This paper focuses on development of a control strategy for optimal use of the BESS for this purpose. The paper considers an open-loop optimal control scheme to incorporate the operating constraints of the BESS, such as state of charge limits, charge/discharge current limits, and lifetime. The goal of the control is to have the BESS to provide as much smoothing as possible, so that the wind farm can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual wind farm data. Furthermore, a real-time implementation strategy using model predictive control is also proposed. Finally, it is shown that the control strategy is very important in improving the BESS performance for this application.},

And a 2D analytical method is also presented to compute the air gap flux density for this dual-rotor single-air-cored-stator axial-flux surface-mounted permanent magnet machine structure. Then, a 3D FEA model is developed to validate the accuracy of these two proposed 2D methods. Finally, a prototype machine is fabricated, and experiments are carried out to test its performances and electromagnetic features. Experimental results confirm that the 2D FEA and analytical approaches are both efficient and simple with sufficient accuracy.},

The analysis performed considers the effects of modulation index, pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) schemes, and interleaving angle. Based on the analysis, the impact of interleaving on the design of ac passive components, such as ac line inductor and electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter, is discussed. The results show that interleaving has the potential benefit to reduce ac passive components. To maximize such a benefit, the interleaving angle should be optimized according to the system requirements, including total harmonic distortion limit, ripple limit, or EMI standards, while considering operating conditions, such as modulation index and PWM schemes. Experimental results have verified the analysis results.},

In a discrete implementation of the classical DTC scheme, the time delay associated with data processing results in additional torque and flux ripples. This part of the ripples can amount to a significant fraction of the overall ripple if the hysteresis bands are comparable to the maximum torque and flux variations in one sampling interval. This paper presents a prediction scheme with low computational complexity and low parameter sensitivity, both comparable to the standard DTC scheme. The prediction scheme can easily be extended to compensate for multiple time delays when the sampling frequency is raised but the computation time remains unchanged. Experimental results show the diminishing effect of the prediction scheme on the torque and flux ripples.},

The MMF space harmonic amplitude and frequency depend on the particular combination of number of slots and poles. Such harmonics induce losses in the rotor since they are not synchronous with the rotor speed. This paper compares two kind of machines with the same stator lamination but with different number of phases, a three phase and a five-phase PM machine. Several winding configurations are compared, changing the number of poles but maintaining the same number of slots. Although in each case there is a reduction in terms of harmonic contents, it is shown that rotor losses reduction is lower than expected. Some considerations about the harmonic impact are given.},

Accurate modeling of different wind turbine technologies is becoming a necessity as wind turbines replace conventional units in the production side. This paper describes models for two major variable speed wind turbine types - namely Electrically Excited Synchronous Generator (EESG) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). Steady state principles of both types are analyzed and mathematical modeling of crucial components is described. The behavior and operation of the system during stochastic wind speed series is simulated using software tools Matlab and Power Factory. The two configurations are accessed based both on the steady state characteristics and the control system designs. The paper covers a wide range of control methods, which are implemented in both wind turbine schemes. Regarding the PMSG scheme, an advanced damping controller to damp possible oscillations excited in the drive train is presented and its contribution to the safe operation of the wind turbine is explained. In the alternative direct drive scheme (EESG) three different control methods applied in the electrical system are presented.},

We develop and compare two algorithms for optimally supplying renewable power to time-flexible electricity loads in the presence of a spot market, backward dynamic programming and approximate dynamic programming. We describe how our proposition compares to price responsive demand in terms capacity gains and energy market revenues for renewable generators, and we determine the optimal capacity of deferrable demand which can be reliably coupled to renewable generation.},

The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

abstract = {This paper develops a coordination control strategy for wind farms with line commutated converter-based HVdc delivery for participating in inertial response and primary frequency control. The coordination philosophy is to feedback the grid frequency and its derivative and adjust the delivery power of the HVdc link according to the feedback signals. The feedback loop employing the derivative of the grid frequency aims to improve the inertial response while the feedback loop employing the grid frequency deviation introduces a droop at the rectifier control loop. When the grid frequency is too high or too low, active power flow through the HVdc link will be ramped down or up. In turn, the wind generation will increase or decrease the blade angles to reduce or increase the captured wind power through pitch control. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the inertial enhancement and frequency droop in HVdc control. Simulation results in transient security assessment tool are given.},

The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules.

Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50{\%} lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

The MPDTC scheme is designed to keep the motor torque and stator flux and the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while reducing the average switching frequency of the inverter, in comparison with the standard direct torque control (DTC) method. The algorithm is embedded in the control software environment of ABB's ACS6000 medium-voltage drive, and experimental results are provided which verify the advantageous features of MPDTC in terms of average inverter switching frequency reduction.

Some basics about CMR and the design of the sensor are given. Several sensors were used and calibrated in the course of static transient railgun experiments. Here, varying spatial field distributions due to the use of different rail materials were recorded. Magnetic-field measurements during railgun operation with projectile velocities exceeding 1000 m/s have been successfully performed. By comparison with 3-D finite-element calculations, interesting results concerning magnetic diffusion have been worked out.},

This project began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Fall of 1995, and later expanded through collaborations with the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Clark Atlanta University, and the University of Maryland at College Park.  The overall objective of the Micro Engine Project was to develop a small but power-dense gas turbine generator based on MEMS fabrication technologies. Thus, the project sought to develop a fuel-burning jet engine that would drive an electric generator to produce electric power for general purpose use.  Along the way, the project would advance the science and engineering of many disciplines from the MEMS perspective.  The Micro Engine Project was by its very nature a highly mult-disciplinary project pursuing advances in materials, structures, fabrication, combustion, heat transfer, turbomachinery, bearings and electromechanics, all at the MEMS scale.  Many of these topics are addressed in this volume, including:    materials structures and packaging multi-wafer MEMS fabrication and and bonding technologiesElectroplating magnetic components electroplating magnetic structures into silicon very-high-speed air bearings thermofluids and turbomachinery electric and magnetic generators combustion    About The MEMs Reference Shelf:  'The MEMs Reference Shelf is a series devoted to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMs) which combine mechanical, electrical, optical, or fluidic elements on a common microfabricated substrate to create sensors, actuators, and microsystems.

The proposed approach, based on a modified inertial control scheme, takes advantage of the fast response capability associated with electronically-controlled WECS, allowing the kinetic energy stored by rotational masses to be partly and transiently released in order to provide earlier frequency support. An additional improvement is achieved by communicating the WECS response to conventional generators so that these can eventually take care of the full load imbalance. Several simulations using a two-area test system are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {The requirements for driving gallium nitride (GaN) heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) and the design of a resonant drive circuit for GaN power HFET switches are discussed in this paper. The use of wideband III-nitride (such as GaN) devices today is limited to telecom and low-power applications. The current lack of high-frequency high-power drivers prevents their application in power converters. The proposed circuit is based upon resonant switching transition techniques, by means of an LC tag, to recover part of the power back into the voltage source in order to reduce the power loss. This circuit also uses level shifters to generate the zero and negative gate-source voltages required to turn the GaN HFET on and off, and it is highly tolerant to input-signal timing variances. The circuit reduces the overall power consumed in the driver and thus reduces the power loss. This is particularly important for high-frequency driver operation to take full advantage, in terms of efficiency, of the superior switching speed of GaN devices. In this paper, the topology of the low-power-loss high-speed drive circuit is introduced. Some simulation results and preliminary experimental measurements are discussed.},

abstract = {When the wind power accounts for a large portion of the grid power, it may need to help the grid voltage and frequency regulation. This paper investigates a permanent-magnet wind generator with a full power voltage-source converter in weak-grid mode, where the DC-link voltage needs to be controlled from the generator side instead of the grid side. The energy relationship of the wind generator, DC-link energy storage, and load is established. An intrinsic right-half-plane zero, together with the wind power characteristics, the mechanical system inertia, and the DC-link energy storage, is identified as the physical limitations for the control. With the understanding of the system energy relationship and limitations, a hybrid adaptive control algorithm is proposed that searches for the optimal generator acceleration to achieve the maximum wind generator power change rate to match the load power variation. The proposed control scheme is verified through simulation of a 1.5-MW wind system as well as through the experiment of a scaled 1-kW, DSP-/field-programmable-gate-array-controlled, permanent-magnet-generator-based test bed. The results show that it is feasible to regulate DC link by the generator-side converter through the generator speed control. Some important applications issues are also investigated, including the DC-link energy storage requirement, wind speed change impact, and control transition between the weak-grid and strong-grid modes.},

abstract = {This article presents the outcomes of a recent study carried out among wind energy manufacturers and developers regarding the current generation costs of wind energy projects in Europe, the factors that most influence them, as well as the reasons behind their recent increase and their expected future evolution. The research finds that the generation costs of an onshore wind farm are between 4.5 and 8.7 ???cent/kWh; 6-11.1 ???cent/kWh when located offshore, with the number of full hours and the level of capital cost being the most influencing elements. Generation costs have increased by more than 20{\%} over the last 3 years mainly due to a rise of the price of certain strategic raw materials at a time when the global demand has boomed. However, the competitive position of wind energy investments vis-??-vis other technologies has not been altered. In the long-term, one would expect production costs go down; whether this will be enough to offset the higher price of inputs will largely depend on the application of correct policies, like R{\&}D in new materials, O{\&}M with remote-control devices, offshore wind turbines and substructures; introduction of advanced siting and forecasting techniques; access to adequate funding; and long-term legal stability. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The overall efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems connected to the grid depends on the efficiency of direct current (DC) of the solar modules to alternate current (AC) inverter conversion. The requirements for inverter connection include: maximum power point, high efficiency, control power injected into the grid, high power factor and low total harmonic distortion of the currents injected into the grid. An approach to power factor control and reactive power regulation for PV systems connected to the grid using field programmable gate array (FPGA) is proposed. According to the grid demands; both the injected active and reactive powers are controlled. In this paper, a new digital control strategy for a single-phase inverter is carried out. This control strategy is based on the phase shift between the inverter output voltage and the grid voltage, and the digital sinusoidal pulse width modulation (DSPWM) patterns, in order to control the power factor for a wide range of the inverter output current and consequently the control and the regulation of the reactive power will be achieved. The advantage of the proposed control strategy is its implementation around simple digital circuits. In this work, a simulation study of this strategy has been realized using Matlab/Simulink and PSIM. In order to validate its performance, this control has been implemented in a FPGA. Experimental tests have been carried out demonstrating the viability of this control in order to control the power factor and the injected power into the grid. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Based on the state-of-the-art in the relevant fields, the main objectives of the project are: a) To achieve self-organized TiO 2 nanotubes (NTs) with a similar degree of order as with porous Al 2 O 3 and Si. This part of the work is mainly carried out at the coordinators' laboratory and is performed constantly over the duration of the project. It has been possible to generate porosity in many different valve metals so far [1-7] which is a very promising precondition for this part of the project. The very interesting results in this area have shown that there is a broad range of systems that can be treated to generate porous structures and that, depending on the conditions of anodizing, various pore dimensions, orientations, conformations and morphologies can be obtained. A further important aspect is the influence of annealing procedures, which is investigated in parallel. Overall, there will be more significant effort put into the art of creating new porous structures under different conditions. b) The properties of all the different systems achieved in (a) are investigated with surface analytical techniques, in particular SEM, XPS, AES, RBS, NRA, MEIS and ToF-SIMS. c) The key mechanisms leading to self-ordering (field effects, chemical effects, stress induced effects, etc.) have to be identified and investigated in order to understand better the driving forces for pore development, continued growth, and self-ordering. The investigations related to this milestone are performed at UM and at FAU, particularly with TEM and the surface analytical techniques mentioned in (b) and later work packages. These detailed studies are carried out on every new system that shows tube growth under certain conditions. This objective is therefore relevant to every system investigated and is an important part of the project throughout its overall duration. d) The possibility to exploit the self-organized TiO 2 nanotubes, with focus on solar-energy conversion (dye-sensitized solar cell), is addressed. The effect of doping and dye sensitization will be investigated in detail. The properties of self-organized TiO 2 nanotube layers and their performance, compared with currently used nanostructured systems produced by TiO 2 nanoparticle sintering, is determined in this step. The research related to this milestone is mainly carried out in Greece by Dr. P. Falaras's group at the NCSRD as they have the highest state of knowledge in this area. Nonetheless, researchers will be exchanged between the institutes in order to guarantee the exchange of knowledge and ideas. NCSRD provides the synthesis of new sensitizers presenting broad and intense metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption bands in the visible like Ru(II) complexes of bipyridine (bipy), terpyridine (terpy), phenanthroline and related ligands bearing carboxylic or phosphonic acid functional groups and their efficient incorporation (and optimisation) in dye-sensitised photoelectrochemical solar cells, having a solid-state structure and using polymer based redox NMP Priority 3 Specific Targeted Research Projects Ti-Nanotubes Project No: 033313, Final Activity Report-Full Duration 2 electrolytes. Surface chemical modification of the Ti-Nanotubes by noble metal deposition and N, S, P doping is performed for direct application in photocatalytic processes, including fabrication, modeling, and evaluation of photocatalytic reactors for efficient photodegradation of water (azo-dyes) and air pollutants (volatile organic compounds, VOCs). Eventually, superhydrophylic surfaces with self-cleaning and anti-fogging properties will be developed. This objective is split into two main parts: first, fundamental research on the newly developed systems from objectives a), b) and c) and their comparison in terms of the photo-response and second, the development of new photo-active nanotube-systems (ideas are based on the results obtained with the already investigated nanotube arrays) which in turn will be produced at the FAU (a). The main innovative aspect is the application of new nanotube-structures that have been produced by anodizing under different experimental conditions. The investigation methods performed in (b) and (c) gave a clear insight into the mechanisms of pore generation and growth and the investigations and application in (d) revealed aspects that are important for the technological improvement of the produced nanotubes. The different systems have been classified in terms of their technological value and new ideas for improvement of the systems can be developed and optimized simultaneously.},

@article{Hsieh2009,
abstract = {Adequate contact pressure needs to be applied at electrical contacts to overcome contact separation force due to current constriction effects. In the railgun operation, the initial contact pressure is provided by the interference pressure between the armature and the rail. As the magnetic field is established in the bore, the electromagnetic force provides the contact pressure, as the initial contact pressure reduces due to wear or contact melting. Excessive initial contact pressure may delay the motion of the armature and cause overheating of the armature. On the other hand, insufficient initial pressure would result in contact separation of armature and rail. The contact interface is never perfectly smooth. It only contacts at discrete asperities at micro scale and at discrete points due to deformation of the contact interface at macro scale. The interface characteristics are different from the bulk behavior. A detailed model of contact resistivity is essential to compute the interfacial current density and temperature distributions accurately. A contact resistivity model was developed that is a function of contact pressure, the hardness of the softer contact member, average bulk resistivity, and contact constants. The model was implemented into the code EMAP3D. This paper presents the simulation results of the start-up of a sample railgun with and without contact resistivity.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on direct torque control (DTC) for three-phase AC electric drives. A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed that keeps the motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the controller predicts several future switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results in the second part of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50{\%} while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC. Second, the scheme is applicable to a large class of (three-phase) AC electric machines driven by inverters.},

In this paper, besides boosting PV array voltage to required value, maximum power point tracking, and interfacing to the grid, a Z-source based grid connected photovoltaic system is used as a reactive power compensator (RPC). Its main feature is the capability to compensate the reactive currents drawn by grid or nonlinear loads while simultaneously injecting into the grid the maximum power available from the cells. Injecting active power and compensation of the reactive current of the system are realized simultaneously at daylight. When the insolation is weak or the PV modules are operative at night, the RPC feature of PV system can still be used to improve the utilization factor of the system. The simulation results validate the feasibility of the method.},

abstract = {This paper deals with experiments and calculations performed in order to investigate the influence of the electromagnetic hardening of payloads in a railgun. This is a complex task: besides the large amplitudes of the in-bore magnetic fields due to the pulsed current, the exit of the projectile from the muzzle and the consequences of plasma arcs have to be considered. At the muzzle the magnetic induction can drop from several Teslas to zero within some microseconds, leading to very high induced voltages and electric fields in the metallic parts of the projectile. On the other hand, the electric contact established by solid armatures tends to develop into electric arcs at high velocities during the launch. These plasma arcs as well as the closing switch transients of the railgun circuit are a source of electromagnetic radiation in a broad spectral range. Some electronic devices were selected and tested with static setups corresponding to the previous conditions. In a first phase a series of static railgun experiments (no projectile movement) was performed. In a second phase, static experiments simulating the muzzle exit conditions were carried out. Finally, the influence of electromagnetic waves emitted during railgun experiments on electronic devices was investigated, using a static setup with a conventional spark gap.},

The objective of this paper is to evaluate various wind generator systems by optimization designs and comparisons. In this paper, seven variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) wind generator systems are investigated, namely permanent magnet synchronous generators with the direct-driven (PMSG-DD), the single-stage gearbox (PMSG-1G) and three-stage gearbox (PMSG-3G) concepts, doubly fed induction generators with the three-stage gearbox (DFIG-3G) and with the single-stage gearbox (DFIG-1G), the electricity excited synchronous generator with the direct-driven (EESG-DD), and the VSCF squirrel cage induction generator with the three-stage gearbox (SCIG-3G). Firstly, the design models of wind turbines, three/single stage gearbox and power electronic converter are presented; design optimizations of the investigated wind generator systems are developed with an improved genetic algorithm. Next, the optimization designs are implemented of various wind generator systems at 0.75-MW, 1.5-MW, 3.0-MW, 5.0-MWand 10MW, respectively. The annual energy production (AEP) per cost are evaluated for a given wind climate. The comparative results show the wind generator system with the single-stage gearbox could be the most attractive choice, especially the DFIG-1G system.},

Evidence suggests VSEC is also the primary mechanism responsible for the contact voltage drop. VSEC effects are seen in both elec- tromagnetic launcher (EML) efficiency and breech voltage.We compare theoretical predictions of system efficiency and breech voltage to experimental measurements for both a conventional and an augmented railgun. The characterization of VSEC extends our previous theoretical work in this area and provides new insights into the physics of EML operation, especially with regards to the armature and sliding contact. VSEC is a significant energy loss mechanism and heat source, possibly contributing to contact erosion and transition. We propose a similar VSEC mechanism to explain velocity saturation and efficiency roll-off in plasma and hybrid armature railguns, as well as arc restrike.},

abstract = {The Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) has tested a high-inductance-gradient series-connected two-turn railgun. The primary goal of these experiments was to launch a dual-armature launch package in the two-turn configuration while maintaining electrical isolation between the rail and armature pairs. Two tests with the dual-armature launch package on a single-turn configuration independently examined the performance of the launch package. Results of those tests showed good thermal and structural performance of the armature assembly and no melt transfer between the armature contact regions. Five tests were then conducted on the two-turn rail configuration. During the second test, the crossover that connects the two rail pairs at the breech suffered arcing damage at the rail contacts. A new crossover was fabricated, and all subsequent tests were successful with no crossover arcing. The final system had a propulsive inductance gradient of 1.8 muH/m, with projectiles successfully launched in excess of 400 m/s at linear current densities up to 35 kA/mm.},

A dis- tributed automatic control approach is proposed to alleviate the voltage rise caused by active power injection. The objective of the proposed approach is not to control bus voltage but to guarantee that generator injections alone do not cause significant voltage rise: a solution in which distribution network operators (DNOs) are kept to their traditional task of voltage regulation for load demand. The approach is discussed in the perspective of effectiveness and ade- quacy. Its consequences toDNOcontrol effort are evaluated. Illus- tration is provided for a single feeder with stochastic generation and transformer on-load tap-changing voltage regulation.},

Solution to the problem results in the determination of the capacity of the BESS to ensure constant dispatched power to the connected grid, while the voltage level across the dc-link of the buffer is kept within preset limits. A computational procedure to determine the BESS capacity and the evaluation of the dc voltage is shown. Illustrative examples using the proposed design method are included.},

@article{Yang2008,
abstract = {This paper proposes a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system that is consisted of a boost converter with maximum power tracking, battery charge controller, inverter, and the related control circuits. A sliding mode controller is designed for controlling the boost converter to output the maximum power of the solar cells. A control strategy is proposed of a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) impendence adapter coupling a photovoltaic generator to a battery. The proposed strategy is based on the sliding mode control theory of continuing systems to permit a direct control of power converter. The PV generator price is even relatively high, so the user is interested of the optimal coupling of PV generator to electromechanical loads. In fact, this system uses the optimal coupling in order to have maximum power during the whole operating period. A grid-connected inverter is designed to transform the maximum output power into the load and utility. The real power control is using zero-cross and phase-lock circuits that control the inverter output voltage which is phase lead and synchronized with the utility. A digital circuit is used to detect the phase angles of the load voltage and current to control the inverter output amplitude to achieve the reactive power load compensation. A monitor circuit is designed to detect the voltage and frequency variation in the utility. When the photovoltaic system encounters a voltage and frequency deviation, the monitor circuit immediately disconnects the photovoltaic system from the utility to prevent the island effect. The proposed system is implemented by using OP amplifiers and micro controller (PIC16F877A). Both the simulation and experimental results using MATLAB show the sliding mode controller for maximum power tracking has good performance. The phase and amplitude control experiments achieve the real and reactive power control. The island effect experiments demonstrate evidence of the solar cell system protection ability illustrating the proposed grid-connected photovoltaic system has good operating performance.},

abstract = {SSPAs are largely used in Navigation and Telecom satellites. Some Payloads may require more than 100 off SSPAs. In this case, most of the payload power is used to supply these SSPAs. EPCs (Electronic Power Conditioner) supplying these SSPAs are then high performance DC/DC converters. Mass and efficiency are the 2 drivers for these DC/DC converters as they could be numerous on a satellite. Usually, these EPCs were presented as modules outside of the SSPA. It has appeared that some mass can be saved if the EPC could be implemented in the same chassis as the SSPA. This paper details the solutions developed for a 60W EPC to be delivered as a PCB without mechanical frame. Parts are selected to cope with thermal management of the PCB embedded in the SSPA host chassis. EPC switching frequency has been optimized to reduce losses without increasing too largely the size of the filtering elements. The main performances achieved by this 60W EPC are detailed and illustrated by measurements recorded on one EM board.},

abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Thermal energy storage has recently attracted increasing interest related to thermal applications such as space and water heating, waste heat utilization, cooling and air-conditioning. Energy storage is essential whenever there is a mismatch between the supply and consumption of energy. Use of phase change material (PCM) capsules assembled as a packed bed is one of the important methods that has been proposed to achieve the objective of high storage density with higher efficiency. A proper designing of the thermal energy storage systems using PCMs requires quantitative information about heat transfer and phase change processes in PCM. This paper reviews the development of available latent heat thermal energy storage technologies. The different aspects of storage such as material, encapsulation, heat transfer, applications and new PCM technology innovation have been carried out. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The integration of an electrical machine and power electronics promises many benefits, the largest being an increase in power density. The use of system integration may lead to an increase in loss density and local or component temperatures. For this reason much attention needs to be paid to the thermal design aspects of the system. In the aerospace industry weight and reliability are of significant importance. In this paper the integration of a permanent magnet machine and power electronics into a single structure with joint thermal management is investigated. An overall goal of 2 kW/kg is set for system power density. Additionally in this paper fault tolerance is introduced into the design. This will allow the system to continue functioning should a single electrical fault occur. Principle faults are identified and discussed. A 50 kW, 6 phase, 8 pole permanent magnet machine is presented with a rotor speed of 50 krpm. A symmetrical phase shifted full bridge is used to drive the permanent magnet machine, aiding the functionality of fault tolerance and enabling the use of soft switching. A mathematical model for both machine and power electronics is created and used to calculate phase currents and losses in the machine and power electronics. Finally, spatial integration and thermal management concepts are presented and analysed.},

abstract = {Inductance gradient of railgun is one of the most important parameters to railgun launch efficiency. The inductance gradient of simple railgun without metal container (tube) can be calculated via Kerrisk's approximate formula when the structure of rails is fixed. However, the metal container would be necessary if the repulsion on the rails is great enough in mega Ampere current railgun. Then eddy current will be induced in metal container because of the variable magnetic flux density. In this paper, the effects eddy current putting on the inductance gradient of railgun are investigated with Maxwell 3D modular of Ansoft Corp.. Models of railgun with metal-insulated combination containment (laminated containment) are simulated and compared with solid metal containment railgun and air containment railgun. The eddy current density and Lorentz force put on amature of each model are calculated. It is found that the inductance gradient fluctuates with the armature position relative to containment and the fluctuating amplitude decreases with the electrical conductivity. The reduction of inductance gradient is very little when the metal segments of containment are not wider than caliber. It's notable that the inductance gradient decreases rapidly near muzzle.},

abstract = {This paper presents optimal control of a five-phase Integrated Modular Permanent Magnet Motor for normal and open-circuit fault conditions. Finite element analysis of the motor is carried out to obtain output torque of the motor. It is found that the output torque ripple of the machine when supplied with sinusoidal currents is considerably high. An optimum control technique is presented to operate the machine with minimum torque ripple and least stator ohmic loss. Furthermore, an optimum fault tolerant control method under open-circuit fault conditions is presented. Due to the half bridge and split capacitor configuration used for this modular motor drive the neutral voltage fluctuates considerably during the fault condition. To solve this problem, a constraint to make the summation of the phase currents to zero is incorporated in the derivation of the fault tolerant optimal control strategy. Optimal currents are calculated for normal and open-circuit fault-tolerant operation of the machine. Simulation results are presented for the verification of the control methods. Although the control techniques discussed in this work are applied for the five phase modular permanent magnet machine, they can be extended for multiphase permanent magnet machines with any number of phases.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of the input voltage unbalance and sags on the dc-bus electrolytic capacitors in adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) in order to predict their impact on expected capacitor lifetime. The key phenomenon that causes these problems is the transition of the rectifier stage from three-phase to single-phase operation. Since the equivalent series resistance increases at low frequencies, the low-order harmonic current components (e.g., 120 and 240 Hz) contribute disproportionately to the capacitor power losses and temperature rise, resulting in reduced lifetime. Closed-form expressions are developed for predicting these effects including the impact of finite line impedance, finite bus capacitance, and varying load. The impact of inverter space-vector pulsewidth-modulation switching on the capacitor loss is also included. Simulations and experimental tests are used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the closed-form analysis using a 5-hp ASD system},

abstract = {In distributed energy production, permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) are often connected to the grid via frequency converters, such as voltage source line converters. The price of the converter may constitute a large part of the costs of a generating set. Some of the permanent magnet synchronous generators with converters and traditional separately excited synchronous generators could be replaced by direct-on-line (DOL) non-controlled PMSGs. Small directly networkconnected generators are likely to have large markets in the area of distributed electric energy generation. Typical prime movers could be windmills, watermills and internal combustion engines. DOL PMSGs could also be applied in island networks, such as ships and oil platforms. Also various back-up power generating systems could be carried out with DOL PMSGs. The benefits would be a lower price of the generating set and the robustness and easy use of the system. The performance of DOL PMSGs is analyzed. The electricity distribution companies have regulations that constrain the design of the generators being connected to the grid. The general guidelines and recommendations are applied in the analysis. By analyzing the results produced by the simulation model for the permanent magnet machine, the guidelines for efficient damper winding parameters for DOL PMSGs are presented. The simulation model is used to simulate grid connections and load transients. The damper winding parameters are calculated by the finite element method (FEM) and determined from experimental measurements. Three-dimensional finite element analysis (3D FEA) is carried out. The results from the simulation model and 3D FEA are compared with practical measurements from two prototype axial flux permanent magnet generators provided with damper windings. The dimensioning of the damper winding parameters is case specific. The damper winding should be dimensioned based on the moment of inertia of the generating set. It is shown that the damper winding has optimal values to reach synchronous operation in the shortest period of time after transient operation. With optimal dimensioning, interference on the grid is minimized.},

In this way the stiffness requirements of the rotor and the stator are drastically reduced, which leads to large mass savings in the mechanical structure and enables a further diameter increase, which then results in mass reductions also in electrically active parts. The design is based on excitation by use of rare-earth permanent magnets. In other aspects the electrical design is conventional.},

abstract = {The accurate measurement of the magnetic field distribution during electromagnetic launch experiments is an ambitious task. Loop sensors are widely used for detecting the change in magnetic flux. However, this technique is mostly used only for qualitative purposes, e.g., for triggering various devices. This paper deals with the use of another type of high magnetic field sensor based on thin ({\&}lt;1 mum) manganite films, which exhibit the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect. This sensor measures the magnitude of the magnetic induction and can have very small sensitive areas (e.g., 0.5 mmtimes50 mum). Some basics about CMR and the design of the sensor are given. Several sensors were used in experiments performed with the ISL-launcher EMA3 (E{\textless}sub{\textgreater}prim {\textless}/sub{\textgreater}=0.6 MJ, l=3 m, cal=15 mmtimes30 mm). Transient magnetic field profiles with rise times of approximately 50 mus and amplitudes up to 4 T were recorded. The results obtained with the CMR sensors are compared with those of conventional loop sensors. Also, some metrological peculiarities due to high-frequency coupling to the detector circuit are mentioned. The highly local measurements of these CMR sensors were validated by results obtained from 3-D finite element (FE) calculations of the magnetic field distributions},

@article{Widyan2006,
abstract = {This thesis presents design, optimization, construction and test of radial-flux low-speed rare-earth high-energy permanent-magnet (PM) electrical machines with new topology. Two of the designed machines can be used as directly driven wind energy generators. Due to absence of the field current and field winding, permanent magnet generators exhibit high efficiency in operation, simple and robust structure in construction and high power to weight ratio. The attractiveness of the permanent magnet generators is further enhanced by the availability of high-energy permanent magnet materials like NdFeB. Based on the equivalent magnetic circuit approach and permanent magnet load line characteristics, iterative preliminary design for the proposed generator was firstly carried out. The aim of this simple linear pre-design tool was to have an initial geometry for the detailed investigations of the finite element technique (FET) where the electromagnetic behavior of the machine was optimized. The stator of the machine was slotted. Slotted configuration was chosen as it permits lower effective air gap length and therefore thin magnets can be used. This, in fact, largely decreases the cost of active material as it is dominated by that of the magnets. However, cogging torque comes as a consequence of slots. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated using the flux-MMF technique enhanced by the FET. Cogging torque is an oscillatory torque caused by the variation of the co-energy of the permanent magnets with respect to the rotor position, resulting from the variation of the magnetic circuit seen by the magnets. It is an inherent characteristic of slotted permanent magnet machines. It should be studied and minimized in the applications where minimizing torque ripple, vibration and noise are essential requirements. The configuration of the rotor corresponding to the lowest cogging torque was adopted. The prototype machine was constructed using novel updated high-energy permanent magnets with a remanent of 1.41T. The stator laminations of the machine were cut using laser technology methods. The slots of the machine were flat and the windings were of toroidal type (torus) with short ends. This, in turn, reduced the cost and weight of active material and improved the efficiency. The permanent magnets were rectangular blocks of NdFeB with flux concentration arrangement and magnetized tangentially on the rotor support structure. Soft magnetic material is attached to both poles of the permanent magnets, which not only produced an easy path for the flux penetration but also reduced the leakage flux and therefore a typical ‘rule of thumb' value for the leakage flux coefficient was achieved. The rotor support structure of the machine was manufactured from nonmagnetic light material (Aluminum). To further reduce the total weight of the machine, longitudinal holes were excavated inside the rotor support structure. The constructed prototype machine was tested as variable low-speed generator with different loading conditions. Good agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimentally obtained results has been achieved. The inertia of the system together with the cogging torque necessitated a peak starting torque of 64{\%} of the rated torque. To reduce this starting torque, the slot openings were filled up with bonded soft magnetic material with a relative permeability equals 10. The peak value of the starting torque has been reduced to 43{\%} of the rated torque. The cogging torque of the machine was estimated again and the performance of the slot-filled machine was studied and compared with the previous case. The manufactured prototype machine was single phase. Three-phase is also possible. The number of phases is usually determined based on the type of the load and the rated power demand. Finite element analysis and theoretical study were carried out on two three-phase machines of the same topology. The first one is a four-pole three-slot machine and the second one is ten-pole six-slot design.},

abstract = { Electromagnetic launchers suffer a phenomenon referred to as armature transitioning: when the armature and rails suddenly lose contact with each other, damage can occur to the armature and the rails of the launcher. In this paper, we explore transient elastic waves as a possible explanation for the transitioning of solid armatures in electromagnetic launchers. We use a finite-element code to model the transient dynamics of a typical electromagnetic launcher guide rail. We found that dynamic rail deflections caused by the movement of the armature are similar in magnitude to those caused by the magnetic field, and that the contact pressure between the armature and the rails changes dramatically when the speed of the armature reaches the critical velocity of the rails.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to compare five different generator systems for wind turbines, namely the electrically-excited and the permanent-magnet excited direct-drive generator system, the permanent-magnet and the doubly-fed induction generator system with single-stage gearbox and the doubly-fed induction generator system with three-stage gearbox. The comparison is based on cost and annual energy yield for a given wind climate. The doubly-fed induction generator with single-stage gearbox seems the most attractive in terms of energy yield divided by cost. The doubly-fed induction generator with three-stage gearbox is a cheap solution using standard components. The permanent-magnet direct-drive generator has the highest energy yield, but although it is cheaper than the electrically-excited direct-drive generator, it is more expensive than the generator systems with gearbox},

Currently, there is an increase of voltage and current harmonics in power systems, caused by nonlinear loads. The active power filters (APFs) are used to compensate the generated harmonics and to correct the load power factor. The proposed control design is a pulse width modulation control (PWM) with two blocks that include neural networks. Adaptive networks estimate the reference compensation currents. On the other hand, a multilayer perceptron feedforward network (trained by a backpropagation algorithm) that works as a hysteresis band comparator is used. Two practical cases with Matlab-Simulink are presented to check the proposed control performance.},

abstract = {A drive based on a matrix power converter for a 30 kW totally enclosed, fan cooled induction motor was developed to be fully integrated within the spatial envelope of the motor, located inside the end cover at the fan end of the machine. This paper describes the thermal design of the motor to dissipate the losses from the drive, which were approximately a third of those from the motor. The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems. An improved fan geometry was designed to keep the power electronics cool under high ambient temperatures with the motor running at full load},

abstract = {This thesis presents an alternative approach to the analytical design of surface-mounted axialflux permanent-magnet machines. Emphasis has been placed on the design of axial-flux machines with a one-rotor-two-stators configuration. The design model developed in this study incorporates facilities to include both the electromagnetic design and thermal design of the machine as well as to take into consideration the complexity of the permanent-magnet shapes, which is a typical requirement for the design of high-performance permanent-magnet motors. A prototype machine with rated 5 kW output power at 300 min-1 rotation speed has been designed and constructed for the purposesof ascertaining the results obtained from the analytical design model. A comparative study of low-speed axial-flux and low-speed radial-flux permanent-magnet machines is presented. The comparative study concentrates on 55 kW machines with rotation speeds 150 min-1, 300 min-1 and 600 min-1 and is based on calculated designs. A novel comparison method is introduced. The method takes into account the mechanical constraints of the machine and enables comparison of the designed machines, with respect to the volume, efficiency and cost aspects of each machine. It is shown that an axial-flux permanent-magnet machine with one-rotor-two-stators configuration has generally a weaker efficiency than a radial-flux permanent-magnet machine if for all designs the same electric loading, air-gap flux density and current density have been applied. On the other hand, axial-flux machines are usually smaller in volume, especially when compared to radial-flux machines for which the length ratio (axial length of stator stack vs. air-gap diameter)is below 0.5. The comparison results show also that radial-flux machines with alow number of pole pairs, p {\textless} 4, outperform the corresponding axial-flux machines.},

This study explored a range of bore and rail geometries and looked at their effects on key railgun system parameters such as parasitic mass, inductance gradient, linear current density, required pulse forming network (PFN) size, and barrel mass. Preliminary solid modeling and structural analysis of the integrated launch package was performed in order to quantify parasitic mass. Inductance gradient calculations were based on a current density distribution analysis. A PFN/Launcher numerical simulation model was then used to determine linear current density and PFN size. Finally, barrel mass was estimated by structural analysis based on calculated rail repulsive forces. Trends and sensitivities of the different parameters to changes in the bore and rail geometries are presented and conclusions are given.},

A 1-{\&}mu;H inductance can be achieved at 5 MHz with dc resistance of 1{\&}Omega; and a Q of four. Thin film magnetic materials, compatible with semiconductor processing, offer power loss density that is lower than ferrite by a factor of 5 at 10 MHz. Other data reported includes, lowest dc resistance values of 120 m{\&}Omega; for an inductance of 120 nH; highest Q of 15 for an inductance of 350 nH and a current of 1 A for a 1- {\&}mu;H inductor. Future technology challenges include reducing losses using high resistivity, laminated magnetic materials, and increasing current carrying capability using high aspect-ratio, electroplated copper conductors. Compatible technologies are available in the power switch, control, and packaging space. Integrated capacitor technology is still a long-term challenge with maximum reported values of 400 nF/cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the design procedure for a permanent-magnet (PM) wind generator, which is optimized for energy capture over a wide operating range (i.e. a range of speeds and loads). This is achieved by using an optimisation routine to find the permutation of generator design variables, which maximises its energy capture when operated through the normal operating regions of a variable speed wind turbine. In so doing, the efficiency vs. speed curve of the generator is shaped to produce a high average efficiency over the operating range of the turbine. This is in direct contrast to conventional machine design methods of producing a high absolute efficiency at a single operating point (i.e. rated speed and load)},

Present network design practice is to limit the generator capacity to the level at which the upper voltage limit is not exceeded with maximum generation and minimum load. This reduces the efficiency of DG system. This paper examines the local voltage variation and presents a method combining power factor and voltage control modes used selectively for embedded generators in distribution network with its maximum utilization.

The notional concept includes a 15 kg projectile with a 2.5 km/sec muzzle velocity. The choice of bore and rail geometry for such a weapon can influence key aspects of the total system design. This study explored a range of bore and rail geometries and looked at their effects on key railgun system parameters such as parasitic mass, inductance gradient, linear current density, required pulse forming network (PFN) size, and barrel mass. Preliminary solid modeling and structural analysis of the integrated launch package was performed in order to quantify parasitic mass. Inductance gradient calculations were based on a current density distribution analysis. A PFN/Launcher numerical simulation model was then used to determine linear current density and PFN size. Finally, barrel mass was estimated by structural analysis based on calculated rail repulsive forces. Trends and sensitivities of the different parameters to changes in the bore and rail geometries are presented and conclusions are given.},

This deposited metallization not only bonds the power chips, but also provides the second-level interconnect wiring. The associated components are mounted on top of the integrated power stage. This packaging scheme results in a three-dimensional (3-D) multiple chips/components assembly with the capability of functional integration. In this paper, the electrical and thermal parameters of this packaged module have been experimentally and theoretically characterized. The procedures adopted for the defined fabrication processes are presented. In addition to the characteristics of the planar integration process, the improved electrical and thermal performance has been demonstrated.},

abstract = {Induction motors are commonly coupled to a gearbox when an application requires a low speed and a high torque. The gearbox is costly, needs maintenance and decreases the efficiency of the drive. Therefore, taking away the gearbox is very advantageous. This can be made possible by using a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor running directly at low speed, so called direct-drive PM synchronous motor. In this thesis, low-speed direct-drive PM motors are investigated for a 4.4 kW, 50 rpm mixer used for wastewater treatment. The thesis begins with an overview of different existing low-speed direct-driven applications. It concentrates then on a few topologies that are promising for the considered application: five different radial-flux PM machine configurations with surface-mounted or buried permanent magnets and two Torus axial-flux PM machine configurations. The designs of the PM machines are conducted by solving an optimization problem. The goal is to minimize the active weight of the machine, while fulfilling the requirements on the outer dimensions, the efficiency and the cost. The design process, based on analytical calculations as well as finite-element simulations, is described taking the particularities of each topology into account. Designs of low-speed radial-flux PM machines with high pole numbers are first calculated with conventional distributed windings and one slot per pole per phase. The results obtained for different PM machine configurations are compared. To improve further the designs, concentrated windings are investigated for PM machines with high pole numbers. Concentrated winding layouts offering high winding factors and limiting the rotor losses as well as the noise and vibrations of the machine are identified and sorted out. Some interesting concentrated winding layouts are combined with the different radial-flux PM machine configurations and further investigated with FEM simulations. The design of axial-flux PM motors is treated separately in the thesis. It was found that the Torus axial-flux PM machines are not satisfying the requirements of the application. Therefore multi-disk axial-flux PM machines are investigated. Finally, the investigated theoretical designs suitable for the application are compared and their advantages and drawbacks are emphasized.},

abstract = {A simple probabilistic method has been developed to predict the ability of energy storage to increase the penetration of intermittent embedded renewable generation (ERG) on weak electricity grids and to enhance the value of the electricity generated by time-shifting delivery to the network. This paper focuses on the connection of wind generators at locations where the level of ERG would be limited by the voltage rise. Short-term storage, covering less than 1 h, offers only a small increase in the amount of electricity that can be absorbed by the network. Storage over periods of up to one day delivers greater energy benefits, but is significantly more expensive. Different feasible electricity storage technologies are compared for their operational suitability over different time scales. The value of storage in relation to power rating and energy capacity has been investigated so as to facilitate appropriate sizing.},

abstract = {The thesis deals with the issue of cost reduction in direct-drive generators for wind turbines. Today, the combination gearbox-medium-speed (1000-2000 rpm) induction generator largely dominates the market of MW-scale wind turbines. This is due to the lower costs of the gearbox option compared to the costs of gearless systems. Nevertheless, there is an acute interest among researchers and wind turbine suppliers in the possibility of removing gears and slip rings from the drive train, leading to lower maintenance (no oil is required and slip rings can be avoided) and higher reliability due to the absence of wear between gears.$\backslash$nThe direction followed by the thesis is the investigation and comparison of various permanent magnet (PM) machine topologies. The aim is to identify the topology(ies) with the lowest cost/torque and highest torque/ mass. A new TFPM geometry, called TFPM machine with toothed rotor, is derived in the. The new machine topology has the following characteristics: the stator is single-sided, the rotor PM and flux concentrators are independent from the build-up of mechanical tolerances, the installation of rotor parts (PM and flux concentrators) can be automated and the flux circulation allows laminated steel to be used in the stator core. A prototype of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor is presented. $\backslash$nThe comparison between TFPM machines with toothed rotor and conventional PM synchronous machines is discussed. Comparison of the cost/torque and torque/mass of the two machine topologies for diameters ranging between 0.5 m and 3.0 m showed favorable expected performances of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor for diameters of 0.5 m and 1.0 m. However, diameters larger than 1.0 m favored the conventional PM synchronous machine with/without flux-concentration. $\backslash$nUsing the results of the optimization process, the costs of active material are computed for a 1.5 MW wind turbine. It is found that active material represents about 5{\%} of the total turbine cost, while previous estimates indicated that the generator costs are rather between 30{\%} and 40{\%} of a complete direct-drive wind turbine. Therefore, further optimiza{\^{A}}¬tion of direct-drive machines should also include the costs of manufacturing and the costs of the mechanical structure.},

abstract = {The two best-known methods for calculating high-frequency winding loss in round-wire windings-the Dowell method and the Ferreira method-give significantly different results at high frequency. We apply 2-D finite-element method (FEM) simulations to evaluate the accuracy of each method for predicting proximity-effect losses. We find that both methods can have substantial errors, exceeding 60{\%}. The Ferreira method, which is based on the exact Bessel-function solution for the eddy current in an isolated conducting cylinder subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, is found to be most accurate for loosely packed windings, whereas the Dowell method, which approximates winding layers comprising multiple turns of round wire with a rectangular conducting sheet, is most accurate for closely-packed windings. To achieve higher accuracy than is possible with either method alone, we introduce a new formula, based on modifying the Dowell method. Parameters in the new formula are chosen based on fitting our FEM simulation data. By expressing the results in terms of normalized parameters, we construct a model that can be used to determine proximity-effect loss for any round-wire winding with error under 2{\%}.},

Relevant tests at high frequencies are carried out to validate the method.

abstract = {Currently, assemblies of power semiconductor switches and their associated drive circuitry are available in modules. MOSFETs and IGBTs are used as switches and these elec- tric gated devices facilitate the incorporation of gate driving functions in the module. These mod- ules are sometimes also provided with limited internal sensing and protection functions. From a few 100 watts downward, one finds silicon monolithic technology as the integration vehicle, while upward into the multi-kilowatt range, mixed mode module construction is used. This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnect structures. The article addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced inte- gration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced inte- gration. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs). The technology underpinning such an IPEM approach is discussed. The fundamental functions in electronic power processing, the materials, processes and integration approaches and future concepts are explained. Ample use is made of illustrations, photographs of integrated modules and subsystems to en- hance the value of the article to the non-specialist},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {This paper explores the factors that affect the accuracy of$\backslash$nnumerical analysis of railguns with motion using Electromechanical$\backslash$nAnalysis Program in Three Dimensions (EMAP3D), a Lagrangian finite$\backslash$nelement method (FEM) code that models thermal and electromagnetic$\backslash$ndiffusion into conductors with moving interfaces. In situations$\backslash$ninvolving sliding electric contact between conductors, EMAP3D solves a$\backslash$nseries of velocity-dependent diffusion problems in which the armature$\backslash$nmoves to different axial positions that satisfy the equations of motion$\backslash$nfar the armature. This paper develops two relationships between time$\backslash$nstep size and solution accuracy. One relationship is a lower bound on$\backslash$ntime step size, based on the need for linear brick elements to represent$\backslash$naccurately the exponential-like spatial variation of current density as$\backslash$ncurrents diffuse into conductors. The other relationship is an upper$\backslash$nbound, which limits the motion of the armature to distances on the scale$\backslash$nof the current distribution around the armature. Because the upper bound$\backslash$ndecreases with increasing velocity, the two bounds eventually converge,$\backslash$nat which point accurate solutions to problems involving motion are no$\backslash$nlonger possible for given mesh dimensions. The velocity at which$\backslash$naccurate solutions are possible can be increased by increasing the$\backslash$nresolution of the mesh. At present, a practical limit to simulating$\backslash$nrealistic railgun problems is less than 500 m/s. Because this limit is$\backslash$nset by rapidly advancing state-of-the-art computer hardware, the$\backslash$nprospects for achieving higher velocities in the near future are good$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between the traditional radial field permanent-magnet brushless machine and four unique configurations of axial field permanent-magnet brushless DC machines. These consist of a single-gap slotted axial field machine, a dual-gap slotted axial field machine, a single-gap slotless axial field machine, and a dual-gap slotless axial field machine. The comparison is done at five power levels ranging from 0.25 to 10 kW. A rated speed of 2000 r/min is chosen for the 0.25-kW designs while 1000 r/min is chosen for the rest of the designs. The trends in performance and sizing for the different power outputs are obtained to get an understanding of the capability of various machine configurations. The comparison consists of required copper, steel, and magnet weights, copper and iron loss, moment of inertia, torque per unit moment of inertia, power per unit active weight, and power per unit active volume for five different power levels. For a given application, the results provide an indication of the machine best suited with respect to performance and size. The basis for the comparison is described with details on the design procedure},

However, a new 24 hours application as an extended area can be added by the active utilization of the potential ability of PV power conditioners. For this purpose, a new multi functional power conditioner was developed which has a smoothing function to reduce PV output variation and load fluctuation, and also has additional function to compensate harmonics current and reactive power caused by customer's load. As a result of indoor testing, a reduction rate of 1/5 for harmonic currents and 1/7 for reactive power were achieved. In addition, a 1/10 reduction rate for smoothing of PV output variation and load fluctuation was observed. The work has been promoted by NEDO as a part of New Sunshine Project in Japan},

The mathematical model providing the 3-D simulation of processes in an electrodynamics accelerator channel includes the Maxwell system of equations in a quasi-stationary approximation, the heat conduction equation and the equation for kinematic characteristics of the accelerated armature.

The novelty lies in combining a motor analysis procedure with a genetic algorithm to optimise an objective function such as the motor torque, the efficiency, the material cost or some other motor figures or a combination of these. Two approaches to the motor analysis are presented: the first is based on a fully analytical procedure; while the second utilises the finite element method. Some optimised design examples, with reference to surface-mounted permanent-magnet three-phase motors, are included, and a comparison between the genetic algorithm optimisation technique and the classical hill-climbing direct-search method is made. A discussion on the limitations and benefits of the proposed design approach concludes the paper},

abstract = { Arcing transition of metal-to-metal contacts is a key technical challenge in the development of railgun launchers.  Theoretical understanding of the process remains poor and controversial. Several authors have explained transitioning by a velocity skin effect driven "melt wave" Others have shown experimentally, that arcing transition even occurs for static contacts subject to high current pulses, and have proposed a "contact resistance" model, with the contact resistance due to A-spots. This model explained the available experimental data reasonably well for armatures with relatively short lengths of the contact zone. The velocity skin effect model assumes a perfect, resistance free contact, while the contact resistance model neglects any velocity related effects. In this paper we combine the two approaches to obtain a more realistic picture of the velocity skin effect and its role in transitioning of armature contacts. We show that when realistic properties of the contact interface are taken into account, the structure of the velocity skin effect and the speed of a wave of local transitioning may significantly differ from the "ideal" theory.},

@article{Braun1989,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Musgrove1983,
abstract = {The global wind-energy resource is very large and widely distributed; and, within Europe, wind energy has the potential to provide an energy output equal to about three times the present electricity consumption. Although the wind is not very reliable as a source of power from day to day, it is a reliable source of energy year by year, and the main role for future wind-energy systems will be operating in parallel with electricity grid systems or, in remote locations, in parallel with diesel engines, so saving fuel. Systems integration studies indicate that existing utility grid systems could accept a contribution of about 20{\%} from wind turbines, although, with changes to the future plant mix, the potential contribution is substantially greater: and similar percentage fuel savings are possible in remote locations with wind/diesel systems. Recent progress in the development of wind turbines is reviewed and the cost data now becoming available indicates that medium-sized machines, i.e. ? 20?40 m diameter and with power ratings in the range 50?500 kW, offer the most attractive economics for land-based applications in the near future, giving energy costs in the range 2.8?5.6 p/kWh, for a typical site where the annual average wind speed is 5.5 m/s (measured at the normal 10 m height); in windier locations energy costs will be lower. Corresponding capital costs for installed wind turbines are in the range 锟?50?1500/kW (with average outputs equal to about 30{\%} of the rated). The UK, in common with some other countries, has a large offshore wind-energy potential, but, to be economically competitive, offshore systems will need to use multimegawatt wind turbines with diameters of 100 m and larger. Prototype machines in this size range already exist, but considerable further development is needed before the construction of large offshore wind turbine arrays can commence, although this is a realistic prospect for the 1990s. The economics of wind-energy conversion systems are alr- eady encouraging, and commercial applications already in evidence, most notably in the USA and Denmark where more than 2000 wind turbines with a total installed capacity in excess of 150 MW have been installed in the past two years. However, further operational experience is required to demonstrate that reliable operation can be sustained over periods of many years. As this experience is accumulated, and as the cost benefits associated with quantity production are achieved, the market for wind turbines can be expected to expand rapidly.},

abstract = {Spacecrafts rely on electric motors for Important functions such as attitude control, deployment mechanisms, throttle valve control, etc. Electric motors for space applications must have long life and high reliability, under high vacuum, radiation, and wide operating temperature environments. Although various types of motors are available, all of them are not suitable. Limitations of ac synchronous motors and brushes and commutators of conventional dc motors are given. Brushless dc motors and stepper motors, which are widely used, are discussed in detail. Problems of conventional lubrication and bearings and the advantages of magnetic bearings are also discussed. In a totally noncontacting system, such as a brushless dc motor/stepper motor with magnetic bearing, life and reliability are functions of only electronic components, and they can be improved to the desired level. Thus this paper gives the problems and prospects of electric motors for space applications.},

The method consists in dividing the winding into portions, calculating the d.c. resistances and d.c. leakage inductances of each of these portions, and then multiplying the d.c. values by appropriate factors to obtain the corresponding a.c. values. These a.c. values are then referred to, say, the primary winding and summed to give the total winding resistance and leakage inductance of the transformer. Formulas are derived and quoted for calculating the d.c. resistances and leakage inductances of the winding portions. Theoretical expressions are derived for the variation with frequency etc. of the factors by which the d.c. values must be multiplied to obtain the corresponding a.c. values. These expressions are presented in the form of graphs, permitting the factors to be read as required.},
